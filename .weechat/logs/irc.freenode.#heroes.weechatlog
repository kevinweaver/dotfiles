2013-10-14 16:41:39	kweaver_laptop	hold off on that stuff for now, Im not even 100% about

2013-10-14 16:42:48	kweaver_laptop	aight
2013-10-14 16:43:06	kweaver_laptop	rename the folder you currently have your work in
2013-10-14 16:43:09	kweaver_laptop	the whole project folder
2013-10-14 16:43:32	kweaver_laptop	change it from ems_heroes to ems_heroes_nemsis
2013-10-14 16:43:43	jchaike	ok
2013-10-14 16:43:50	kweaver_laptop	and ill invite you to the new repo

2013-10-14 16:44:56	kweaver_laptop	dont worry about pulling that repo
2013-10-14 16:45:17	kweaver_laptop	i branched out into a second one because the databases are pretty different
2013-10-14 16:45:37	kweaver_laptop	so I started a new one specifically for the flu stuff
2013-10-14 16:45:46	kweaver_laptop	without the nemsis database backend
2013-10-14 16:45:57	jchaike	okay

2013-10-14 16:46:25	kweaver_laptop	then clone the new repo with:
2013-10-14 16:46:30	kweaver_laptop	git clone git@bitbucket.org:kevinweaver/ems_heroes.git
