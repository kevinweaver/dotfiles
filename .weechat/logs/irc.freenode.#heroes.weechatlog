2014-10-08 15:26:58	jchaike	few thing about invoices i thought of: invoices for an agency should never be duplicated
2014-10-08 15:27:10	jchaike	but there could be 5 invoice number 1's for the billing agency
2014-10-08 15:28:11	kweaver	correct.  thats why invoice.id is what we use for our own internal primary key, and then invoice.invoice_number is what we should be submitting to char

2014-10-20 12:07:39	kweaver	haha yeah i like it
2014-10-20 12:08:11	kweaver	anyway continue with your 1500 file for now, but shortly im gonna have to do some stuff in the db/seeds.rb
2014-10-20 12:08:12	kweaver	file
2014-10-20 12:11:01	jchaike	ok sure
2014-10-20 13:01:43	kweaver	k jchaike whenever youre at a good break point with the 1500 form
2014-10-20 13:01:51	kweaver	check out /db/seeds.rb
2014-10-20 13:02:02	kweaver	you will see an example of what i need you to do
2014-10-20 13:02:11	kweaver	i created new models called:
2014-10-20 13:02:16	kweaver	Master::ProcedureCode 
2014-10-20 13:02:17	jchaike	is this on develop?
2014-10-20 13:02:19	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-20 13:02:23	jchaike	ok cool
2014-10-20 13:02:27	kweaver	Master::InsuranceCarrier
2014-10-20 13:03:21	kweaver	you are going to the massive list of 500 insurance carriers that char gave you, and use your sublime magic so enter them as actual records in the seed file
2014-10-20 13:03:29	kweaver	going to take***
2014-10-20 13:03:45	kweaver	look at my procedure codes as examples
2014-10-20 13:04:42	kweaver	but essentially we are going to keep a separate, ongoing table where we can populate it with our full list of insurance carriers, procedure codes, and diagnosis codes
2014-10-20 13:04:59	kweaver	then once an agency sees one they want to use, we just duplicate that one carrier into their own set of carriers
2014-10-20 13:05:20	kweaver	that way we arent populating 500 carriers for every single agency
2014-10-20 13:09:47	kweaver	lemme know if you understand jchaike 
2014-10-20 13:09:56	jchaike	ah sorry let me catch up on that
2014-10-20 13:10:48	jchaike	yeah i got it
2014-10-20 13:10:56	jchaike	but as far as the concept of "once an agency sees one they want to use"
2014-10-20 13:11:03	jchaike	thats something the user does in a settings menu somewhere?
2014-10-20 13:11:05	jchaike	kweaver
2014-10-20 13:11:23	kweaver	correct
2014-10-20 13:12:43	kweaver	or on the invoice form, we only populate the carriers they have used before, and then if they dont see the one they want, we give them a modal that has our current chosen of alllll insurance carriers, and when they click save, it does the duplication
2014-10-20 13:13:53	jchaike	right
2014-10-20 13:13:55	jchaike	ok cool
2014-10-20 13:13:59	jchaike	so nothing really on my end with the seeds
2014-10-20 13:14:06	kweaver	nah thatll be later
2014-10-20 13:14:25	kweaver	for now you just want to make a line for every carrier like i did for the procedure codes
2014-10-20 13:14:34	jchaike	sure
2014-10-20 13:14:42	jchaike	im pulling up the latest develop now
2014-10-20 13:15:10	kweaver	the file you had originally with all the carriers, what did that have for each carrier?
2014-10-20 13:15:18	kweaver	just name, npi, and chars value? or more
2014-10-20 13:15:45	jchaike	name, universally accepted id, and char's id
2014-10-20 13:15:51	jchaike	and the "universally accepted id"
2014-10-20 13:15:53	jchaike	char doesnt even care about
2014-10-20 13:16:01	jchaike	its just for someone like amanda who may remeber the id quicker than the name
2014-10-20 13:16:02	jchaike	or something
2014-10-20 13:16:07	jchaike	just a better way of searching
2014-10-20 13:16:51	kweaver	i believe the universally accepted id will go in the 'payer_id' column
2014-10-20 13:17:22	kweaver	i already annotated app/models/master/insurance_carrier.rb, so open that up to see your columns
2014-10-20 13:17:32	jchaike	ok awesome
2014-10-20 13:17:34	jchaike	got it
2014-10-20 13:18:19	kweaver	im thinking your array should only have those three values then.  dont do a bunch of empty strings for all the other columns
2014-10-20 13:18:22	kweaver	ex: 
2014-10-20 13:18:51	kweaver	["Blue Cross Blue Shield - New Jersey", "12345", "54321]
2014-10-20 13:19:05	kweaver	errrr
2014-10-20 13:19:23	kweaver	actually you have a "coverage_state" column
2014-10-20 13:19:49	kweaver	put your state values in that
2014-10-20 13:19:51	kweaver	soooo
2014-10-20 13:20:02	jchaike	oh hm
2014-10-20 13:20:07	jchaike	ill have to look thoruhg it
2014-10-20 13:20:13	jchaike	im not sure if ill know the answer to all of them
2014-10-20 13:20:18	jchaike	unless they all specifically have a state listed
2014-10-20 13:20:19	kweaver	yeah get started and do the first couple
2014-10-20 13:20:23	kweaver	true
2014-10-20 13:20:32	kweaver	we could also do:
2014-10-20 13:21:04	kweaver	["Blue Cross Blue Shield - New Jersey", "12345", "54321", "NJ"]  <-- last column will be the converage_state column when listed
2014-10-20 13:21:30	jchaike	so insurance name, insurance_id, chars_id, state_of_coverage
2014-10-20 13:21:35	kweaver	["Someshit", "12345", "54321", ""]
2014-10-20 13:21:50	kweaver	yeah, and then leave state blank when you dont know
2014-10-20 13:21:53	jchaike	sure
2014-10-20 13:22:08	jchaike	alright i think ive got it covered, ill let you know if i run into any snags
2014-10-20 13:22:38	kweaver	that way we can be cool and sort by state when they want to look at the list.  saves us from the 15 second delays when possible
2014-10-20 13:23:26	jchaike	yeah thatd be awesome
2014-10-20 13:27:20	kweaver	I would still list the state in the description too though
2014-10-20 13:33:14	jchaike	even though we can populate the chosen with that state field?
2014-10-20 13:36:53	kweaver	yeah its a tradeoff either way
2014-10-20 13:37:41	jchaike	ok sure
2014-10-20 13:38:04	kweaver	its up to you
2014-10-20 13:38:09	kweaver	which is easier
2014-10-20 13:38:13	jchaike	ok ill see what happens when i sort through it
2014-10-20 13:39:02	jchaike	wait why are there so many fileds in this?
2014-10-20 13:39:44	jchaike	whats category for insurance carrier
2014-10-20 13:39:48	jchaike	oh like the 1-7
2014-10-20 13:39:57	jchaike	nvm
2014-10-20 13:41:06	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-20 13:55:48	kweaver	jchaike: when youre working on that, commit with "HERO-173"
2014-10-20 14:05:28	jchaike	sounds good
2014-10-20 14:35:38	kweaver	how goes it jchaike 
2014-10-20 14:35:59	jchaike	not bad
2014-10-20 14:36:03	jchaike	im not going to add the states though
2014-10-20 14:36:09	jchaike	it really only applies to maybe 50/2000
2014-10-20 14:36:27	jchaike	i started to, but then that means i have to add a blank state field to each of the items in that array
2014-10-20 14:36:36	kweaver	gotcha
2014-10-20 14:36:37	kweaver	alright
2014-10-20 14:37:18	jchaike	like most of htem are pretty generic like "Aetna"and highmark - key family
2014-10-20 14:37:38	jchaike	i dont think those are really state specific, so a state specific search wouldnt return proper results, unless we do specifically listed as NJ, and all listed as nothing
2014-10-20 14:44:22	jchaike	kweaver i just do a rake db:poulate to execute the seeds right?
2014-10-20 14:44:36	kweaver	nah, rake db:reset will do it
2014-10-20 14:44:38	kweaver	reset does:
2014-10-20 14:44:49	kweaver	rake db:drop, rake db:create, rake db:seed
2014-10-20 14:44:56	jchaike	ohh ok

2014-10-20 15:27:39	jchaike	thats your newly appointed middle name
2014-10-20 15:28:20	kweaver_desktop	its funny how much you can figure out in like a second
2014-10-20 15:28:26	jchaike	insanely creepy
2014-10-20 15:28:31	jchaike	see how mcuh you can find out on me haha
2014-10-20 15:28:45	kweaver	gurlll i already know boutchu
2014-10-20 15:28:57	kweaver	lol
2014-10-20 15:28:58	jchaike	using JUST GOOGLE
2014-10-20 15:29:11	jchaike	i had someone give me my home address and home phone number just from a google search lol
2014-10-20 15:29:16	kweaver	jchaike: i made a new rake task
2014-10-20 15:29:37	jchaike	oh yeah? for what
2014-10-20 15:29:45	kweaver	but im also gonna make an alias that just calls everything
2014-10-20 15:29:49	jchaike	ok cool
2014-10-20 15:29:55	jchaike	the insurance carriers seeds works
2014-10-20 15:30:08	jchaike	i decdied to add a blank field populating the state of coverage
2014-10-20 15:30:14	jchaike	and i will just fill out some of them, it cant hurt
2014-10-20 15:30:26	jchaike	and we can use aliases to determinne some of them as "applicable in all states" or something
2014-10-20 15:31:25	kweaver	that works
2014-10-20 15:31:31	kweaver	push when you get a chance
2014-10-20 15:31:57	kweaver	jchaike: add this to your bash or zsh aliases:
2014-10-20 15:32:19	kweaver	alias rakeall="rake db:reset && rake db:populate && rake db:initialize"
2014-10-20 15:32:46	jchaike	i actually have basically that
2014-10-20 15:32:48	jchaike	i do dbreset
2014-10-20 15:32:53	jchaike	and it does db reset and populate
2014-10-20 15:32:57	jchaike	ill add initialize
2014-10-20 15:34:08	kweaver	rake db:initialize is the new one.  its existance will just be for development, but its purpose is to scan all the agencies and clone over any important records from the Master tables
2014-10-20 15:34:26	jchaike	oh ok cool
2014-10-20 15:34:30	jchaike	whats minitest?
2014-10-20 15:34:33	kweaver	ex: all bls client agencies need the procedure code A0425 to function (mileage)
2014-10-20 15:34:36	kweaver	dunno
2014-10-20 15:34:39	kweaver	where you see that?
2014-10-20 15:34:50	jchaike	ems_heroes(develop): rakeall
2014-10-20 15:34:50	jchaike	Could not find minitest-4.7.5 in any of the sources
2014-10-20 15:34:50	jchaike	Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
2014-10-20 15:35:00	kweaver	ah dunno
2014-10-20 15:35:08	jchaike	lol ok well its apparently in the gemfile now
2014-10-20 15:35:08	kweaver	i rake into another random bundle issue today though
2014-10-20 15:35:20	kweaver	its most likely just a dependency to something 
2014-10-20 15:35:24	jchaike	lol rake
2014-10-20 15:35:30	kweaver	ran*
2014-10-20 15:35:31	kweaver	lolol
2014-10-20 15:36:03	jchaike	hm
2014-10-20 15:36:06	jchaike	kweaver LoadError: cannot load such file -- hitimes/hitimes
2014-10-20 15:36:15	kweaver	thats the one i ran into
2014-10-20 15:36:32	kweaver	i was getting it when i ran bundle exec annotate
2014-10-20 15:36:46	kweaver	i just did "bundle install annotate" and that fixed it
2014-10-20 15:37:03	kweaver	i also did like 10 other things though
2014-10-20 15:37:07	jchaike	oh haha
2014-10-20 15:37:10	jchaike	well
2014-10-20 15:38:01	jchaike	you mean bundle exec annotate right?
2014-10-20 15:38:08	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-20 15:38:12	kweaver	that
2014-10-20 15:38:19	kweaver	errr
2014-10-20 15:38:20	jchaike	shit lol, this is pretty trivial i cant even reset
2014-10-20 15:39:01	kweaver	hmm
2014-10-20 15:39:09	kweaver	try bundle install
2014-10-20 15:39:17	kweaver	bundle update
2014-10-20 15:40:22	jchaike	im tring gem update --system
2014-10-20 15:40:45	kweaver	i did that as well
2014-10-20 15:40:53	jchaike	mine failed'
2014-10-20 15:41:11	kweaver	im still getting that hitimes issue when i just run 'guard'
2014-10-20 15:41:17	kweaver	though 'bundle exec guard' works fine
2014-10-20 15:41:39	kweaver	i dont even know what hitimes does, its just a dependency for something
2014-10-20 15:42:25	jchaike	but you can rake reset and stuff?
2014-10-20 15:42:33	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-20 15:42:50	jchaike	what was the latest gem you added?
2014-10-20 15:43:00	jchaike	becuase when i did bundle intsall now it installed a new gem, railroady lol
2014-10-20 15:43:28	kweaver	another dependency
2014-10-20 15:43:34	kweaver	i havent added any gems in a while
2014-10-20 15:44:20	jchaike	oh ok
2014-10-20 15:44:37	jchaike	looked like i needed to just do gem instlal hitimes for some reason
2014-10-20 15:44:41	jchaike	when i do rakeall i get this
2014-10-20 15:44:41	jchaike	https://www.dropbox.com/s/10t7vm5w13atbrd/Screenshot%202014-10-20%2015.44.13.png?dl=0

2014-10-20 15:46:09	kweaver	lol wtf
2014-10-20 15:46:19	kweaver	no idea
2014-10-20 15:46:36	jchaike	well then thats insulting, theyre calling your code lazy lol
2014-10-20 15:46:41	kweaver	yeah they are
2014-10-20 15:46:56	kweaver	actually ive made changes since
2014-10-20 15:47:01	kweaver	lemme merge back develop
2014-10-20 15:47:04	jchaike	sure
2014-10-20 15:48:04	kweaver	pull
2014-10-20 15:49:42	jchaike	youre still lazy.... lol
2014-10-20 15:49:47	kweaver	rough
2014-10-20 15:49:48	jchaike	it hink it worked though let me check
2014-10-20 15:50:08	kweaver	try each part individually
2014-10-20 15:50:24	Voltara	hah
2014-10-20 15:50:52	jchaike	HEY Voltara !!
2014-10-20 15:50:59	kweaver	suppppp 
2014-10-20 15:51:38	Voltara	hilarious, my irc client decided to join my efnet channels on freenode instead :-D
2014-10-20 15:51:40	jchaike	yo kweaver so apparently that issue is coming from rake db:reset, and it wont acutally reset
2014-10-20 15:51:46	kweaver	oh damn
2014-10-20 15:51:56	kweaver	so what #heroes were you trying to go to Voltara ?
2014-10-20 15:51:57	jchaike	WAIT theres no other heroes but us!
2014-10-20 15:52:54	kweaver	ok, to go more specific, dont use reset, use rake db:drop, rake db:create, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed
2014-10-20 15:53:09	Voltara	lets see... i think i'm not only one who joins #heroes on efnet anymore.  we created it years and years ago to talk about D&D, but then (a) heroes of might and magic 4 came out, and then (b) the tv show heroes became popular, so we had to flee
2014-10-20 15:53:16	kweaver	or maybe migrate before create
2014-10-20 15:53:28	kweaver	haha
2014-10-20 15:53:31	jchaike	oh wow haha
2014-10-20 15:53:31	kweaver	thats awesome 
2014-10-20 15:53:44	jchaike	kweaver drop does the same thing
2014-10-20 15:53:55	jchaike	im going to do some googlging
2014-10-20 15:53:59	kweaver	k
2014-10-20 15:54:05	kweaver	are you running server or console?
2014-10-20 15:54:14	kweaver	Voltara: you a programer?
2014-10-20 15:54:20	Voltara	yeah
2014-10-20 15:54:26	kweaver	what languages

2014-10-20 15:54:43	Voltara	you guys tryin' to steal my identity or something?  :-)
2014-10-20 15:54:46	kweaver	lol
2014-10-20 15:55:05	kweaver	you do any rails development?
2014-10-20 15:55:15	kweaver	or just php
2014-10-20 15:55:18	kweaver	like everyone else...
2014-10-20 15:55:35	Voltara	no, the languages i tend to deal with are C/C++/PHP/Perl, or whatever happens to need help at work
2014-10-20 15:55:48	jchaike	kweaver can you do ruby -v and rails -v we might have different builds could be interfering with some gems
2014-10-20 15:56:05	kweaver	ruby 2.1.3p242
2014-10-20 15:56:07	Voltara	though i've done just enough ruby to configure puppet
2014-10-20 15:56:13	kweaver	rails 4.0.0
2014-10-20 15:56:16	jchaike	well then lol that could be an issue
2014-10-20 15:56:19	jchaike	ruby 2.0.0p481
2014-10-20 15:56:23	kweaver	ah damn
2014-10-20 15:56:31	jchaike	do you use rvm?
2014-10-20 15:56:34	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-20 15:56:43	kweaver	actually i just updated my ruby when i started getting that issue this morning
2014-10-20 15:56:47	kweaver	so update your ruby
2014-10-20 15:56:55	kweaver	well das cool Voltara

2014-10-20 15:58:23	kweaver	we've got a few php devs in there
2014-10-20 15:58:34	jchaike	kweaver ruby update fixed it
2014-10-20 15:58:40	kweaver	oh cool

2014-10-23 12:32:50	jchaike	yo kweaver
2014-10-23 13:24:47	kweaver	sup jchaike 
2014-10-23 13:24:57	kweaver	i reset the cpanel pass so nevermind
2014-10-23 14:05:36	jchaike	hm? about lunarpages? i never got a mesage about that lol
2014-10-23 14:06:01	jchaike	just had a few min free time, i was talking with Brian yesterday he told me about potentially focusing on tripsheets if the state would give us money for it
2014-10-23 14:06:08	jchaike	was wondering if you guys made a decicion aobut it
2014-10-23 14:06:11	jchaike	kweaver ^^
2014-10-23 14:23:23	kweaver	we talked.  its still entirely dependant on brians discussion with the guy from the state
2014-10-23 14:23:55	jchaike	ok cool, was just wondering, seems like there was a lot of potential in it if the state is like SURE TAKE MY MONEY
2014-10-23 14:23:56	kweaver	between you and me, brian has some VERY lofty hopes about that conversation
2014-10-23 14:25:08	jchaike	yeah i mean, who knows. it seems like a lot of his clients would want something like this, and it would only make amanda's and other biller's jobs easier anyways
2014-10-23 14:25:33	jchaike	i feel like either way no matter which direction we take in developing these different sections of Heroes, we're still moving closer and closer to a finished product either way
2014-10-23 14:26:09	kweaver	yeah, im completely open to going that direct if the opportunity is there
2014-10-23 14:26:43	kweaver	I think he often confuses "his clients wanting a tripsheet" with "there is potential revenue and incentive to building it now"
2014-10-23 14:27:06	jchaike	well i know he has mentioned a few times that some clients have even been like "we'll fund it"
2014-10-23 14:27:42	jchaike	but even Char was pretty into the trispheet idea this time around it seemed
2014-10-23 14:28:25	kweaver	his wording is also usually loose when he talks about that.  one sentence he'll say "so and so offered to fund it." and then next he'll say "i know him well enough that i think if i asked him to fund it, he would"
2014-10-23 14:28:29	kweaver	yeah yeah i am too
2014-10-23 14:28:34	kweaver	i dont want to sound like a debbie downer
2014-10-23 14:29:16	kweaver	but i basically told brian that ill wait to get excited when we can secure some real potential revenue or potential opportunity
2014-10-23 14:30:01	jchaike	i mean either way, it doesnt matter to me. my stake in Heroes is basically I hope it goes somewhere decently big, so then when I graduate in December I'll have a job, and a job doing something that 1) ive been doing 2) something i enjoy 3) working with people i already know i work well with
2014-10-23 14:30:44	jchaike	4) i get to be part of something big, not necessarily since the beginning, but fairly close to the beginning in the grand scheme of things
2014-10-23 14:31:24	kweaver	yeah i agree. i want to keep you around as long as possible.  i think you and i are both extremely flexible between frontend and backend design
2014-10-23 14:31:35	kweaver	most guys i know are either one or the other
2014-10-23 14:31:45	jchaike	yeah i was literally just typing, i dont think many people are like that
2014-10-23 14:31:51	jchaike	lol
2014-10-23 14:31:53	kweaver	and i think you and i are amoung the few 'full stack' developers
2014-10-23 14:32:10	kweaver	among*
2014-10-23 14:32:30	jchaike	^^ something Rowan certainly didn't teach me. lol.
2014-10-23 14:32:42	kweaver	and being a full stack developer attributes very well to a small start up like this
2014-10-23 14:32:56	kweaver	same
2014-10-23 14:33:12	jchaike	my friend is doing is comp sci senior project, they ahve to make a web app with an api that conects to an iOS app.... he doesnt know HTML PHP CSS Javascript Obj-C, SQL, or design...
2014-10-23 14:33:22	kweaver	oh god
2014-10-23 14:33:25	kweaver	good luck...
2014-10-23 14:33:48	jchaike	i was helping him last night, i helped him just design a quick login screen, he sent it to his group mates and they were all like WOW THATS AMAZING lol
2014-10-23 14:33:54	kweaver	at the same time though, if he didnt do anything on his own, then all he will know is java and some C/C++
2014-10-23 14:34:04	jchaike	yeah basically
2014-10-23 14:34:12	kweaver	which is sad
2014-10-23 14:34:23	kweaver	because where is he going to go from there?
2014-10-23 14:34:31	jchaike	but hes a really good Java programmer, as far as like "HOW TO PROGRAM" if he watched that 10 hour michael hartl tutorial, hed probably be pretty good at rails
2014-10-23 14:34:34	jchaike	like he knows the concepts behind it
2014-10-23 14:34:39	kweaver	thats good
2014-10-23 14:34:41	jchaike	but he said to me last night hes like "ive never had to make a UI in my life"
2014-10-23 14:34:46	jchaike	its like WHAT
2014-10-23 14:34:50	kweaver	yeah thats crazy
2014-10-23 14:34:53	jchaike	hes like yeah we used blu-jay my entire college career lol
2014-10-23 14:35:14	kweaver	nooooo
2014-10-23 14:35:15	kweaver	hahaha
2014-10-23 14:35:32	jchaike	theres no way people at Rowan are ready to take on a full time programming job with just the knowledge they leave school with
2014-10-23 14:35:34	kweaver	im cool with the idea of blu-jay for like the first cs intro course
2014-10-23 14:35:39	kweaver	but it has to end there
2014-10-23 14:36:18	kweaver	i have no idea why bergmann is allowed to keep using blujay on students that are ready to graduate
2014-10-23 14:37:22	jchaike	lmao its so absurd to me
2014-10-23 14:37:39	jchaike	yo check out what i just came accross... the first program i ever built and released

2014-10-24 11:26:39	jchaike	yo kweaver do you know how modifiers, diagnosis pointers, and "units" for charges are determined?
2014-10-24 11:26:45	kweaver	sup Voltara 
2014-10-24 13:22:14	jchaike	kweaver next time we have a char call, lets just put her on speaker, apparently we dont need to be courteous to other people in the office
2014-10-24 13:23:04	kweaver	hahahaha
2014-10-24 13:23:06	kweaver	seriously
2014-10-24 13:23:14	jchaike	really? who wants to hear your kid scream on facetime
2014-10-24 13:23:19	jchaike	wait let me answer for you
2014-10-24 13:23:21	jchaike	nobody.
2014-10-24 13:23:29	kweaver	i know a 4 year old, we could hook him up on some suround sound
2014-10-24 13:24:06	jchaike	might as well
2014-10-24 13:24:06	kweaver	uh oh, 'we'd like to show you what we have'
2014-10-24 13:24:07	jchaike	lol
2014-10-24 13:24:29	kweaver	'here's the empty page where we would put a tripsheet form'
2014-10-24 13:24:48	jchaike	lol
2014-10-24 13:25:05	jchaike	he'd probably demo your blue tripsheet one right?
2014-10-24 13:25:10	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-24 13:25:38	jchaike	did you make that with foundations?
2014-10-24 13:25:43	kweaver	which is like throwing a pepsi taste test party, but just offering coke cause its close enough
2014-10-24 13:25:44	kweaver	nope
2014-10-24 13:25:55	kweaver	not responsive
2014-10-24 13:25:55	jchaike	lol
2014-10-24 13:26:01	jchaike	oh right good point
2014-10-24 13:26:03	kweaver	fields are all over the place too
2014-10-24 13:26:30	jchaike	i feel like its really little to no work to make it in heroes though, especeially becuase its simply storing data, not manipulating it or anything like we're doing with invoices
2014-10-24 13:26:40	kweaver	yeah i agree
2014-10-24 13:27:00	kweaver	brian keeps throwing out the idea of just letting people use the php version and i have to keep denying him
2014-10-24 13:27:20	kweaver	and telling him that it would take much longer to get that up an running than to just build a quick form on this
2014-10-24 13:27:41	jchaike	i said that if that php version is using that nemsis database, we'd never be able to export that data and import it into whatever our final heroes solution ends up being
2014-10-24 13:28:01	kweaver	yeah using the php version wouldnt make any sense at all
2014-10-24 13:28:18	jchaike	i think its becuase it looks good. so it appears to be completed
2014-10-24 13:29:32	kweaver	i want to stay optimistic to the opportunity of possibly having heroes promoted on a state wide level.  but realistically, what state-level official would endourse a product that doesnt exist, has no previous users, from a tech company that doesnt have any official products yet?
2014-10-24 13:29:56	kweaver	let alone offer money for it's production
2014-10-24 13:30:08	jchaike	new jersey gives out tons of grants for startups so i dont think its that absurd
2014-10-24 13:30:13	jchaike	but yeah i see what you mean
2014-10-24 13:30:36	jchaike	also i assume we'd say we have 200 users using our 'previous version of the software' which would really just be char's program
2014-10-24 13:30:47	kweaver	so in the absolute best case scenario, the guy is going to say "well let me know when its built, in the meantime, check out this nj grants page and feel free to apply to some"
2014-10-24 13:31:12	jchaike	i mean if they say oh yeah wed like to see what you have
2014-10-24 13:31:21	jchaike	and we can just whip up a quick rails heroes tripsheet in a few weeks
2014-10-24 13:31:29	jchaike	theres really no need to test, we know that scaffolds work
2014-10-24 13:31:41	jchaike	that could be an option
2014-10-24 13:33:35	kweaver	yeah and thats fine.  i just also imagine that for a company like image trend to be endoursed by the state of nj, they were probably in a list of 10 other hugely popular programs.  how disasterous would it be if NJ started telling agencies to go use some program that doesnt have any history

2014-10-27 14:16:12	jchaike	but basically, im pretty sure im having OS X compatibility issues, so I need to reinstall OS X. I'm able to boot but only in safe mode. I have cloud9 setup, so i'm going to work off my tablet while i reinstall OS X
2014-10-27 14:16:33	jchaike	im not going to clock in or anything, this is my fuck up, so ill just deal with it like that.
2014-10-27 14:16:38	kweaver	sounds good
2014-10-27 14:17:14	jchaike	El emailed me back, he is around noon tomorrow. I have a 12:30 clas, but if he is available at 12 i'll have more than enough time to fix his scanning issues
2014-10-27 14:17:20	jchaike	so ill do that tomorrow as well
2014-10-27 14:17:31	kweaver	well just see how it goes.  if you end up getting some work done, just write up some hours.  if not no big, its not like it's your fault
2014-10-27 14:17:47	jchaike	im hoping i can either fix this issue through the re-install, or if that doesnt work, ill be able to run to the apple store tonight and get this all sorted out
2014-10-27 14:17:49	jchaike	im so mad about it

2014-10-29 14:17:38	jchaike	kweaver i dont think this could be done in 2 weeks
2014-10-29 14:17:46	kweaver	not at all
2014-10-29 14:17:55	jchaike	i mean if i worked full time with you maye
2014-10-29 14:18:02	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-29 14:18:27	kweaver	its difficult to manage brians expectations because he gets so emotional about things.  
2014-10-29 14:18:30	jchaike	theres a lot of re-factoring that would make this not just usable, but productive
2014-10-29 14:18:35	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-29 14:18:50	jchaike	i get like anxious thinking about all of this stuff that needs to be done lmao
2014-10-29 14:19:18	jchaike	like we talk about it and its like yeah were almost done! and then we talk about it more i get a pit in my stomach like..holy fuck we're not almost done hahaah
2014-10-29 14:19:46	kweaver	like when i sent that email last month about how flu billing is on the horizon, i sent it because i know brian likes to hear good news about progress, but its almost a double edged sword, because then he starts to make decisions based off of that 
2014-10-29 14:20:25	kweaver	so its whatever.  basically, im going to work under the assumption that we will not be using this for flu billing
2014-10-29 14:20:25	jchaike	and its hard becuase char cant be fully focused on the goal of heroes
2014-10-29 14:20:31	jchaike	shes got so much other shit to deal with we cant expect that
2014-10-29 14:20:32	kweaver	the questions is how to break that to brian
2014-10-29 14:20:45	jchaike	i mean itd be totally awesome
2014-10-29 14:20:52	kweaver	yeah i know
2014-10-29 14:20:55	jchaike	and like if amanda entered in flu info and we just re-entered in the info into heroes
2014-10-29 14:21:03	jchaike	just so its not like her time wasted, its only our time  wasted if that
2014-10-29 14:21:17	kweaver	yeah im fine with doing that initially, even just for more relevant data
2014-10-29 14:21:18	jchaike	i wish we could easily import char's data into heroes lol

2014-10-29 15:38:00	kweaver	why would they make this ipad specific?
2014-10-29 15:38:19	kweaver	why not just make it cloud based?
2014-10-29 15:38:29	jchaike	its like schools saying YOU MUST HAVE AN IPAD.. they get to up the ipad price, and manage the ipad through the cloud
2014-10-29 15:38:36	jchaike	they could also get a enterprise license through apple's dev program
2014-10-29 15:38:40	jchaike	and not put it in the appstore
2014-10-29 15:38:46	jchaike	and it would be like "local distribution" maybe
2014-10-29 15:38:49	jchaike	im not sure why theyd choose that
2014-10-29 15:38:59	jchaike	it looks like crap
2014-10-29 15:39:18	jchaike	people like ipads, if they made this for a toughbook people would just think oh, anodhter ugly app
2014-10-29 15:40:39	kweaver	but it sounds like they made it a legit ipad only app.  makes more sense to make it cloud based and just use phone gap

2014-11-12 10:29:39	jchaike	kweaver kweaver_desktop so the deal with the API is that HEROES wil use this API? or who is using this api
2014-11-12 10:29:41	jchaike	whats the point exactly
2014-11-12 10:49:00	kweaver_desktop	ill explain later jchaike
2014-11-12 10:49:08	jchaike	sure
2014-11-12 10:49:23	kweaver_desktop	basically to give char something to do that wont fug with us, and that will be ultimately useful to heroes
2014-11-12 10:50:15	jchaike	ah ok
2014-11-12 10:50:24	jchaike	so this is really something not to be implemented for potentially a year
2014-11-12 10:51:25	kweaver_desktop	basically, i dont think char realizes the work thats going to be involved
2014-11-12 10:51:36	jchaike	oh lol okay
2014-11-12 10:51:45	jchaike	an api is such an enourmous undertaking
2014-11-12 10:51:50	jchaike	for something with no userbase lol
2014-11-12 10:52:39	kweaver_desktop	yeah, theyve been working on improving eligible api for the last 3 years, and who knows how long ago it actually began
2014-11-12 10:52:50	kweaver_desktop	but that is a product and a company all in itself
2014-11-12 10:52:58	jchaike	right
2014-11-12 10:53:10	kweaver_desktop	which ultimately just leads to a small nice-to-have for heroes:
2014-11-12 10:53:26	kweaver_desktop	the ability to look up if a patient is eligible for something without calling or looking around the internet
2014-11-12 10:53:28	jchaike	it seems like we're stretching heroes as a product very thin
2014-11-12 10:53:35	kweaver_desktop	incredibly thin
2014-11-12 10:53:53	kweaver_desktop	thats why i dont plan on being involved with her api
2014-11-12 10:54:00	kweaver_desktop	id love to
2014-11-12 10:54:08	kweaver_desktop	but we have 5 mountains to climb first
2014-11-12 10:54:13	kweaver_desktop	and yet, i know she will need me to help
2014-11-12 10:54:17	jchaike	right
2014-11-12 10:54:40	jchaike	im stresssed, i cant imagine how youre feeling lol
2014-11-12 10:56:36	kweaver_desktop	the only way to mentally handle everything is to only analyze very small portions and keep your head down.  then do a bi-weekly recap and poke our heads up
2014-11-12 10:56:48	kweaver_desktop	and look at the wasteland ahead of us
2014-11-12 10:56:50	kweaver_desktop	haha
2014-11-12 10:59:08	jchaike	lmao
2014-11-12 10:59:17	jchaike	what a depressed way to explain heroes development process
2014-11-12 11:00:00	kweaver_desktop	hahaha its true
2014-11-12 11:00:19	jchaike	if you have a chance can you explain some of your patient population code (the javascript stuff)
2014-11-12 11:00:22	kweaver_desktop	i think the only truly frustrating part is the lack of understanding from brian
2014-11-12 11:00:29	kweaver_desktop	yeah sec
2014-11-12 11:00:30	jchaike	sure
2014-11-12 11:00:39	jchaike	when i explain thigns to him, i take the programmign aspect out of it
2014-11-12 11:01:38	kweaver_desktop	like yesterday, brian was asking about progress.  i said it was good, but there are still mountains ahead and it doesnt help when im spending entire days helping char.  and he just kinda sulked and looked back at his screen
2014-11-12 11:01:48	jchaike	hm
2014-11-12 11:01:56	jchaike	i mean it is important for char to be as involved as she can be
2014-11-12 11:02:04	kweaver_desktop	yeah its a necessary evil
2014-11-12 11:02:28	jchaike	its only evil becuase she piles all of the unknowns on top of everything else that we know, but havent implemented yet haha
2014-11-12 11:02:49	kweaver_desktop	yeah, and again, she showed me some new views that ive never seen in heroes
2014-11-12 11:02:58	kweaver_desktop	so we have more to look forward to
2014-11-12 11:03:12	kweaver_desktop	never seen in her program before***
2014-11-12 11:03:16	jchaike	lmao
2014-11-12 11:03:30	jchaike	MVP is becoming just "the final release"
2014-11-12 11:03:39	kweaver_desktop	it is
2014-11-12 11:03:44	kweaver_desktop	and i keep resisting
2014-11-12 11:03:47	kweaver_desktop	but it doesnt even matter
2014-11-12 11:03:56	jchaike	because these are all "necessary for a useful proudct"
2014-11-12 11:04:12	kweaver_desktop	and yet, he'll say that about things that dont even exist yet
2014-11-12 11:04:15	kweaver_desktop	in hers
2014-11-12 11:05:27	kweaver_desktop	i also just learned about rake db:migrate:redo
2014-11-12 11:05:34	jchaike	whats that
2014-11-12 11:06:07	kweaver_desktop	when you just run rake db:migrate, 90% of the time it wont actually go back to the beginning and create the db from migrations.  its almost like caching
2014-11-12 11:06:26	jchaike	ohhh
2014-11-12 11:06:35	kweaver_desktop	so if you want to force it to go from the beginning, run it with :redo
2014-11-12 11:06:35	jchaike	so we can do rake db:migrate:redo instead of rake db:migrate in our rakeall?
2014-11-12 11:06:43	kweaver_desktop	yeah thats what im thinking
2014-11-12 11:07:37	kweaver_desktop	it will prevent us from those odd situations where we create a model, later do some changes, later delete the model, and then like 6 months later "oh hey, your migration failed.  whats this model you're trying to change?"
2014-11-12 11:07:45	kweaver_desktop	instead we will find those issues immediately
2014-11-12 11:07:50	jchaike	right, well thats cool
2014-11-12 11:07:59	jchaike	it sounds like something that should happen on rake db:migrate anyways though lol
2014-11-12 11:08:21	kweaver_desktop	i know
2014-11-12 11:08:45	kweaver_desktop	im cool with like a 'cache migrations mode' in the rake settings
2014-11-12 11:08:48	kweaver_desktop	but that shouldnt be a default
2014-11-12 11:08:52	kweaver_desktop	just leads to confusion
2014-11-12 11:09:43	jchaike	yea\
2014-11-12 11:24:43	jchaike	so i need a place to put the payer_id on the insurance carrier... what is OTHER ID NUMBER, and could ij ust rename that to the payer_id?
2014-11-12 11:24:46	jchaike	or should i create a new field?
2014-11-12 11:26:26	jchaike	kweaver_desktop ^^
2014-11-12 11:52:58	jchaike	kweaver_desktop
2014-11-12 11:53:06	jchaike	what is invoice_insurance_carrier in the table?
2014-11-12 11:53:16	jchaike	OH its invoice_insurance_policies
2014-11-12 11:53:17	jchaike	nvm
2014-11-12 12:00:23	jchaike	kweaver_desktop you said that people CAN add their own insurance, but they CANT... char only accepts carriers that have an EAC ID
2014-11-12 12:00:31	jchaike	they can name their insurance carriers whatever they want
2014-11-12 12:00:39	jchaike	but it has to match to an existing one, part of this master database
2014-11-12 12:00:57	jchaike	well i guess if youre not submitting electronically then it doesnt matter

2014-11-12 12:26:12	kweaver_desktop	yeah
2014-11-12 12:26:19	jchaike	and why does AGE matter?
2014-11-12 12:27:36	jchaike	also is the carrier NPI something that CHAR knows? it seems like it from what amanda showed us in char's program
2014-11-12 12:27:43	jchaike	*somethingn that is part of her carrier dB
2014-11-12 12:31:02	kweaver_desktop	yeah, isnt that one of the values we have from her giant list?
2014-11-12 12:31:15	jchaike	its not a value that im populating, or got from her
2014-11-12 12:42:14	jchaike	kweaver_desktop would provider_id then be a string or integer?

2014-11-17 16:00:40	kweaver	in our case, hangouts
2014-11-17 16:00:46	jchaike	that does make sense
2014-11-17 16:00:58	jchaike	i am totally distracted now lmao, i mean its not a huge deal, i can deal with it, but it happens
2014-11-17 16:01:07	kweaver	he was saying that all of their management has to be a programmer to some degree
2014-11-17 16:01:14	kweaver	no middle managers that dont know things
2014-11-17 16:01:41	kweaver	but i even feel bad with how often amanda gets bugged by me and brian
2014-11-17 16:01:53	jchaike	it makes sense i guess becuase they DO software, we do billing, and attempt software
2014-11-17 16:02:05	jchaike	thats like saying you need to be fluent with billing isnt it?
2014-11-17 16:02:36	kweaver	yeah he was just saying that his direct supervisor is a programmer, and the boss of that guy is also a programmer
2014-11-17 16:02:38	kweaver	which is graet
2014-11-17 16:02:47	kweaver	because they know how shitty distractions can be 
2014-11-17 16:03:08	jchaike	yeah
2014-11-17 16:03:14	jchaike	and understand the issues that come with programming
2014-11-17 16:03:19	jchaike	like bugs and setbacks and whatnot
2014-11-17 16:03:46	jchaike	it definitely makes sense to kind of restrict communication to some extent just so we can all focus on work and stuff
2014-11-17 16:03:48	jchaike	it would increase productivitiy
2014-11-17 16:04:46	kweaver_desktop	yeah, and its one thing if you and i are just chatting about something between code sprints.  or if brian notices that were hanging out between thoughts
2014-11-17 16:05:37	kweaver_desktop	but that policy just avoids the situation that happens 12 times a day where i look over and brian is trying to tell me something random
2014-11-17 16:09:20	jchaike	yeah that definitely makes sense
2014-11-17 16:11:06	kweaver_desktop	jchaike: just merged into develop.  we now have one render for patients in invoice_invoice, tripsheet_flu, and patient_patient
2014-11-17 16:11:14	jchaike	awesome
2014-11-17 16:11:28	kweaver_desktop	next im gonna do the same for patient_responsible_party, and invoice_responsible_party
2014-11-17 16:11:34	jchaike	okay cool
2014-11-17 16:11:42	kweaver_desktop	its gonna feel so good when we can make changes so quickly
2014-11-17 16:11:44	jchaike	im going to finish up the populator stuff, make sure it works, then merge to develop
2014-11-17 16:11:50	kweaver_desktop	k
2014-11-17 16:22:04	jchaike	kweaver kweaver_desktop  is UNKNOWN really an acceptable choice for gender?
2014-11-17 16:22:10	jchaike	or should it be male/female only?
2014-11-17 16:24:15	kweaver_desktop	jchaike: remove unknown
2014-11-17 16:24:20	kweaver_desktop	that was left over from nemsis
2014-11-17 16:24:27	kweaver_desktop	and fug dat shit
2014-11-17 16:25:15	jchaike	iiiight
2014-11-17 16:25:30	jchaike	"Snapchat partners with Square, launches Snapcash for instantly sending money between users" now you can PAY for temporary nudes
2014-11-17 16:27:53	kweaver_desktop	lolol
2014-11-17 16:28:22	kweaver_desktop	thats a joke right ^
2014-11-17 16:28:30	jchaike	i made it into a joke
2014-11-17 16:28:33	kweaver_desktop	its sad that im unsure

2014-11-19 10:26:52	jchaike	i just made the age calculator generic so it should work across all patient partials

2014-11-19 10:27:07	kweaver	nah
2014-11-19 10:27:25	jchaike	would that go in the patient.js and then i just include that across all necessary views?

2014-11-19 10:27:34	jchaike	ok sure
2014-11-19 10:37:32	jchaike	kweaver if you look at http://localhost:3000/patient/patients/31/edit does your patient birth_Date show up?

2014-11-19 10:38:30	jchaike	sure
2014-11-19 10:39:50	jchaike	nvm i figured it out anyways. for some reason birth_Date isnt always a datetime. so im going to make a migration that fixes that
2014-11-19 10:39:56	jchaike	kweaver ^
2014-11-19 10:40:04	kweaver	yeah i realized that last week
