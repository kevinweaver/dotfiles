2013-10-26 18:04:50	tommyvyo	where
2013-10-26 18:04:58	tommyvyo	u sign in with facebook
2013-10-26 18:05:18	tommyvyo	u can sign in with social media accounts
2013-10-26 18:05:21	tommyvyo	and create challenges
2013-10-26 18:05:23	tommyvyo	for tasks
2013-10-26 18:05:35	tommyvyo	and u have to check in each day via sms or whatever
2013-10-26 18:05:48	tommyvyo	and whoever breaks the chain first
2013-10-26 18:05:51	tommyvyo	is a fuck bag idiot
2013-10-26 18:05:53	tommyvyo	loser
2013-10-26 18:19:27	kweaver	hmmm
2013-10-26 18:19:50	kweaver	I think theres definitely room for some social productivity games
2013-10-26 18:20:06	kweaver	not a bad idea indeed
2013-10-26 18:20:08	tommyvyo	sure, i just figured this idea is really simple to implement
2013-10-26 18:20:21	tommyvyo	if u dont feel like logging in it can text u
2013-10-26 18:20:23	tommyvyo	u just reply
2013-10-26 18:20:29	tommyvyo	or use an app with push notifications
2013-10-26 18:20:49	kweaver	so what kinda challenges?
2013-10-26 18:21:04	tommyvyo	like
2013-10-26 18:21:11	tommyvyo	a 60 day challenge
2013-10-26 18:21:20	tommyvyo	everyday we'll workout for an hour or something
2013-10-26 18:21:36	tommyvyo	an ongoing (permanent or until one quits or fails) challenge where we'll work on a side project for a little bit everyday
2013-10-26 18:21:44	tommyvyo	or eat healthy
2013-10-26 18:21:45	tommyvyo	anything
2013-10-26 18:21:59	tommyvyo	ima make a 60 day dont do drugs challenge 
2013-10-26 18:22:16	tommyvyo	dude... fuck we could even do like, to monetizie it
2013-10-26 18:22:18	kweaver	do it up
2013-10-26 18:22:32	tommyvyo	make it so everyone has to pay $N to enter
2013-10-26 18:22:47	kweaver	like a group pot?
2013-10-26 18:22:49	tommyvyo	yeah
2013-10-26 18:22:59	tommyvyo	we could take a % of it too
2013-10-26 18:23:11	kweaver	as soon as money is on the line, it becomes a lot easier to lie to yourself about your productivity
2013-10-26 18:23:20	kweaver	so there would need to be concrete evidence
2013-10-26 18:23:22	tommyvyo	there could be a proof requirement
2013-10-26 18:23:29	tommyvyo	"Require proof upload? Check"
2013-10-26 18:23:31	kweaver	connect it to github
2013-10-26 18:23:36	kweaver	check for a commit that day
2013-10-26 18:23:48	kweaver	if its an application related goal
2013-10-26 18:23:52	tommyvyo	nah that limits the market, just make a field
2013-10-26 18:24:06	tommyvyo	"Proof description: You have to upload a picture of your dirty gym clothes everyday." 
2013-10-26 18:24:14	kweaver	lol
2013-10-26 18:24:30	kweaver	yeah that works
2013-10-26 18:24:35	tommyvyo	and then when you check in your picture everyone can tell if ur lying
2013-10-26 18:24:39	tommyvyo	and if everyone votes that you lied, youre out
2013-10-26 18:24:41	tommyvyo	lol
2013-10-26 18:24:53	kweaver	well, maybe a majority vote
2013-10-26 18:25:01	tommyvyo	yea
2013-10-26 18:25:07	kweaver	not bad not bad
2013-10-26 18:25:26	kweaver	whenever I have application ideas, I write up a page in my notebook
2013-10-26 18:25:34	kweaver	i think ive got like 5 
2013-10-26 18:25:50	kweaver	but I figure that way, I can go back and review whenever I have free time
2013-10-26 18:26:47	kweaver	Ive got the same couple fields listed for each idea
2013-10-26 18:26:49	kweaver	Thesis

2013-10-26 18:27:00	kweaver	Target Audience
2013-10-26 18:27:02	kweaver	Summary
2013-10-26 18:30:45	kweaver	not only does it save the idea, i usually end up expanding on it and thinking of other neat aspects by the time I'm done writing about it
2013-10-26 18:30:58	tommyvyo	k can u add this one
2013-10-26 18:31:02	tommyvyo	and write "Actually toms" next to it
2013-10-26 18:31:09	tommyvyo	so i dont forget
2013-10-26 18:31:09	kweaver	NOPE
2013-10-26 18:31:09	tommyvyo	lol
