2013-09-13 13:43:10	jhartigan	yo tommyvyo actually. i was picking my brain the other day.. say someone decided to be a dick and made dns records for a site i hosted on digital ocean as well and had the same nameservers as me
2013-09-13 13:43:23	jhartigan	who gets priority and proof of ownership?
2013-09-13 13:44:48	jchaike	jhartigan,  wouldnt that be an issue anywhere, not just digital ocean?
2013-09-13 13:44:56	jchaike	+ isnt your domain registered under your name, which so is digital ocean, for proof
2013-09-13 13:44:57	jhartigan	yeah
2013-09-13 13:45:19	jhartigan	its an issue anywhere someone has the same dns with the nameservers pointing to the same domain
2013-09-13 13:45:25	jhartigan	im just curious as to how its resolved
2013-09-13 13:45:29	jchaike	is that how domains get "HIJACKED"
2013-09-13 13:45:30	jchaike	lol

2013-09-13 14:08:26	jhartigan	so it wouldnt let me add the same domain if its already on that nameserver?
2013-09-13 14:08:52	tommyvyo	yea
2013-09-13 14:09:29	jhartigan	well i suppose that makes sense then
2013-09-13 14:09:36	jhartigan	didnt think itd be that simple haha
2013-09-13 14:10:50	tommyvyo	i dont think thats how domains get hijacked either
2013-09-13 14:13:12	tommyvyo	i think a few years ago, it might have been cloudfront or some other NY based startup got their domain hijacked from some kid in california and he did it by impersonating security questions on a cell phone account and then changing the nameservers
2013-09-13 14:20:43	jhartigan	guys can i has favor

2013-09-13 16:43:13	jchaike	this is the  "math problem" i got something on sale for 12.50. It was on sale for 50% off. What was the original price? Write a formula to find the original price independent of the discount

2013-09-13 16:44:13	tommyvyo	lol jchaike
2013-09-13 16:44:18	tommyvyo	javascript does weird shit with integers
2013-09-13 16:44:30	jchaike	i did jquery Number(
2013-09-13 16:45:06	jchaike	var ourprice = $(".product-price-value").text();
2013-09-13 16:45:06	jchaike	ourprice=Number(ourprice.replace(/[^0-9\.]+/g,""));
2013-09-13 16:45:19	jchaike	(because it has a $$ in it)
2013-09-13 16:46:15	jharty	well .5(original) = 12.5
2013-09-13 16:46:27	jharty	so 12.5/.5 would be the math
2013-09-13 16:46:45	jchaike	fuck me. thank you jharty  lmfao
2013-09-13 16:46:55	jharty	work retail
2013-09-13 16:47:00	jharty	percentages are cake after that
2013-09-13 16:47:22	jchaike	no i did lmfao, i know HOW to do it... just javascript was giving me answers taht were off by like .10 each time
2013-09-13 16:47:23	jchaike	it was weird
2013-09-13 16:47:29	jchaike	i think my formula was overcomplicated lol
2013-09-13 16:47:35	jharty	cause js isnt staticly typed
2013-09-13 16:47:42	jharty	im not js expert so youd have t look into it
2013-09-13 16:48:04	jharty	probably specify a set number of places after the decimal, namely two, and always to use cieling for the third after it
2013-09-13 16:48:07	jharty	thats my guess anyway
2013-09-13 16:48:31	jchaike	yeah i gotta lok into why js is shit lol thakns jharty
2013-09-13 16:48:51	jharty	alsooo...
2013-09-13 16:49:15	jharty	if youre calculating pricing with js someone could spoof it and potentially send a form with a pirce they set
2013-09-13 16:49:20	jharty	depending on how your shit works
2013-09-13 16:50:37	jchaike	nah its not even for that. theres the list price and "our price" and the our price is crossed off to show you how great of a sale youre getting, and they want it to update live
2013-09-13 16:50:48	jchaike	so its like dynamically updated for a static piece of text
2013-09-13 16:50:49	jchaike	lol
2013-09-13 16:52:44	jharty	thats cool.  just dont want someone spoofing an ajax request and getting shit for pennies
2013-09-13 16:53:46	jchaike	true haha, i'm pretty certain the "list price" is completely independent from the form thats submitted when its added to the car, but ill double check with epople to get myself covered lol

2013-09-17 13:07:30	@tommyvyo	dudes getting a 404 from a server that quite clearly isnt yours, because www.landistitle.com/fuckoffkindly.com is not the same 404

2013-09-17 13:14:25	dtriley4	madness
2013-09-17 13:23:38	kweaver	The weird thing is that whatever dns issue he has, he's claiming that he couldnt access it from home either
2013-09-17 13:24:00	kweaver	he was probably just vps'ing from home though
2013-09-17 13:24:12	kweaver	vpn'ing**

2013-09-17 13:29:19	kweaver	could you imagine two dudes ramming their dicks in your arm pits from behind you?
2013-09-17 13:29:32	kweaver	each way you look, another dick
2013-09-17 13:30:19	kweaver	you can only close your eyes, because even looking forward you see them in your peripheral vision

2013-09-17 15:54:33	erockmazz	and won't leak light
2013-09-17 15:54:43	erockmazz	kweaver: you're daring
2013-09-17 15:54:55	erockmazz	AG isn't very easy
2013-09-17 15:55:22	kweaver_laptop	yeah thats why our last batch didnt turn out very well
2013-09-17 15:55:32	kweaver_laptop	but we wanted to skip right to it
2013-09-17 15:55:32	erockmazz	i did my first partial two weekends ago
2013-09-17 15:55:42	erockmazz	excited to see how that turns out
2013-09-17 15:55:50	erockmazz	I figure I'll do a few partials before doing AG
2013-09-17 15:56:10	erockmazz	you guys should probably have done a few more extracts until they started to turn out good
2013-09-17 15:56:14	@tommyvyo	fuck
2013-09-17 15:56:18	@tommyvyo	im making my own beer too
2013-09-17 15:56:21	erockmazz	so you can narrow down what the issues are
2013-09-17 15:56:47	erockmazz	but more power to you for jumping right in headfirst lol
2013-09-17 15:57:45	erockmazz	it's just that so many different things can impact your outcome - it's hard to narrow down issues when you're doing AG
2013-09-17 15:57:52	erockmazz	by the way
2013-09-17 15:58:07	dtriley4	haha

2013-09-17 16:03:17	erockmazz	i have to assume at least 24
2013-09-17 16:03:36	erockmazz	it was a clone of Surly Furious IPA
2013-09-17 16:03:40	matthewspeak	most recent IPA batch that you had you the party?
2013-09-17 16:03:42	erockmazz	nope
2013-09-17 16:03:52	erockmazz	this one used like 5 different kinds of hops
2013-09-17 16:03:59	erockmazz	and was a lot more involved
2013-09-17 16:04:07	matthewspeak	jam
2013-09-17 16:04:07	erockmazz	dry hopped with 5 oz
2013-09-17 16:04:14	erockmazz	the one at the party was dry hopped with 1 oz
2013-09-17 16:04:19	erockmazz	and brewed with 2
2013-09-17 16:04:36	erockmazz	the new one was dry hopped with 5 and brewed with 1.5
2013-09-17 16:04:48	erockmazz	so it should be a hop kick to the face
2013-09-17 16:05:07	dtriley4	plus those are best enjoyed now while it is a little warm

2013-09-18 00:36:38	kweaver	yeah
2013-09-18 00:37:39	kweaver	so currently you have everything through go daddy right?

2013-09-18 00:38:42	kweaver	so yeah, just add mx records to point to go daddy
2013-09-18 00:38:47	jchaike	but when i try to add a new MX record, it tells me Data needs to end with a dot (.)
2013-09-18 00:39:04	kweaver	yeah you just need a period at the end of the url
2013-09-18 00:39:05	jchaike	but according to go daddy when i called up + on their site, its mailstore1.secureserver.net
2013-09-18 00:39:08	jchaike	oh lol
2013-09-18 00:39:17	kweaver	mailstore1.secureserver.net.

2013-10-01 10:35:14	matthewspeak	if at all
2013-10-01 10:37:53	kweaver	national parks are the tough ones though.  I imagine running one as big as yosemite has to involve some pretty serious overhead
2013-10-01 10:38:06	matthewspeak	true
2013-10-01 10:38:07	kweaver	I dont know the stats, but I imagine the us government is eating some of that cost

2013-10-01 10:42:54	jhartigan	one wrong breeze or a douchebag bird
2013-10-01 10:42:58	jhartigan	and you probably lose life
2013-10-01 10:46:12	matthewspeak	public institutions should keep tabs on who uses them then bill those users at the end of the year.  as a non-profit entity the prices would be lower then private entities that seek to turn a profit.  this would eliminate the need to force 99% of the population who would never even visit yosemite park, to pay for them.

2013-10-01 11:45:13	@MpWilli	just because they use less doesnt mean you have to
2013-10-01 11:45:13	kweaver	so if you want a framework built off sass, why not just use foundation?
2013-10-01 11:45:22	@MpWilli	all i do is add bootstrap.min.css
2013-10-01 11:45:28	@MpWilli	and then have my own stylesheet
2013-10-01 11:45:51	jhartigan	your moms a stylesheet

2013-10-01 11:46:21	kweaver	I know they added small

2013-10-01 11:55:40	tommyvyo	Yea I'm down for that
2013-10-01 11:55:59	jchaike	can i haz GM Mavericks yet? Multi monitor support exists and I CANT HAVE IT YET its KILLING ME
2013-10-01 11:56:36	jchaike	</rant>
2013-10-01 11:56:49	jchaike	sup everyone? MpWilli drkyro ericmazzola jfortunato jhartigan jspeak Koreanderson kweaver kweaver_laptop matthewspeak tommyvyo
2013-10-01 11:56:51	kweaver	can you explain  what maverick's adds for multi monitor support again?
2013-10-01 11:56:56	matthewspeak	no you're not mark cuban
2013-10-01 11:57:07	kweaver	I didnt understand during the press release
2013-10-01 11:57:22	jchaike	basically Mountain Lion and Lion have had full screen apps
2013-10-01 11:57:25	jchaike	but if you have dual monitors
2013-10-01 11:57:34	jchaike	it takes up one full screen, and the other monitor is null
2013-10-01 11:57:57	jchaike	kweaver this is my iTunes in full screen, with both monitors
2013-10-01 11:57:58	jchaike	https://www.dropbox.com/s/z46sq0dr8m9v095/Screenshot%202013-10-01%2011.57.43.png

2013-10-01 11:58:29	kweaver	full screen, meaning when you maximize a window?
2013-10-01 11:58:42	kweaver	or is it different than that
2013-10-01 11:58:44	jchaike	nah this is slightly different
2013-10-01 11:58:58	jchaike	its like a "virtual desktop" window
2013-10-01 11:59:01	jchaike	and its on its own
2013-10-01 11:59:13	jchaike	its like the idea of windows 8 with the full screen apps
2013-10-01 11:59:28	jchaike	they aren't maximized… it is just that single window taking up all aspects of your monitor
2013-10-01 11:59:34	kweaver	okay
2013-10-01 11:59:38	kweaver	I guess that makes sense
2013-10-01 11:59:38	jchaike	whereas a maximized app on Mac still leaves the status bar, and the dock visible
2013-10-01 11:59:51	jchaike	but now with Mavericks you can switch virtual desktops per monitor
2013-10-01 11:59:57	jchaike	rather than swipe desktops and it switches it for both monitors
2013-10-01 12:00:04	jchaike	so its like 2^n desktops lol
2013-10-01 12:02:45	jhartigan	kweaver:  i just read most of that and its very thorough
2013-10-01 12:02:59	jhartigan	everything i like about foundation backs it up
2013-10-01 12:03:11	kweaver	yeah jhartigan
2013-10-01 12:03:15	jhartigan	but the bootstrap 3 syntax
2013-10-01 12:03:28	jhartigan	is some fucking chocolatey mess of an idea
2013-10-01 12:03:30	kweaver	oh man, yeah I didnt see the syntax until just now.
2013-10-01 12:03:42	kweaver	lets remove as many letters as we can
2013-10-01 12:03:43	kweaver	go
2013-10-01 12:03:58	jhartigan	serioulsy
2013-10-01 12:04:08	jhartigan	im surprised it wasnt c-m-4
2013-10-01 12:04:16	kweaver	cm4
2013-10-01 12:04:18	kweaver	no dashes
2013-10-01 12:04:24	kweaver	no room for dashes
2013-10-01 12:04:41	kweaver	cn4   because  n is smaller than an m
2013-10-01 12:09:08	jhartigan	dude the comments on this comparison are amazing
2013-10-01 12:09:18	Koreanderson	i'm reading it now too
2013-10-01 12:09:36	jhartigan	"this is not a good review. You highly favored foundation. I suggest looking at another review which is fair not biased."
2013-10-01 12:11:25	kweaver	lolol
2013-10-01 12:11:27	kweaver	nice
2013-10-01 12:11:47	kweaver	I dont know how you could go over them more thoroughly
2013-10-01 12:12:33	jhartigan	yeah thats my thing. if you dont agree with his opinion thats fine, but its not bias, its his opinionated review
2013-10-01 12:15:05	@MpWilli	kweaver and jhartigan what are you guys doing right now? is this for a new site that youre working on
2013-10-01 12:15:11	@MpWilli	havent you been using bootstrap?
2013-10-01 12:15:28	kweaver	nah we've been using foundation for previous sites
2013-10-01 12:15:36	ericmazzola	they're too cool for bootstrap
2013-10-01 12:15:36	kweaver	and yeah, thisll be for our new site
2013-10-01 12:15:37	ericmazzola	;)
2013-10-01 12:15:38	jhartigan	i havent used bootstrap in forever
2013-10-01 12:15:47	@MpWilli	i honestly would not go to bs3
2013-10-01 12:15:56	@MpWilli	because that syntax is fucking gross!
2013-10-01 12:16:07	kweaver	yeah that alone is a good reason
2013-10-01 12:16:21	kweaver	but that article pretty much spelled out all the other reasons
2013-10-01 12:16:28	@MpWilli	like shit man. that is the most unsemantic thing ive seen in a long time
2013-10-01 12:16:40	jhartigan	its just fucking stupid too
2013-10-01 12:16:41	@MpWilli	however bootstrap does support ie8
2013-10-01 12:16:42	kweaver	I have to say, I wish foundation had half the community supoort that bootstrap had
2013-10-01 12:17:03	kweaver	and I dont really know why they dont
2013-10-01 12:17:11	@MpWilli	kweaver are you just using it for the grid?
2013-10-01 12:17:26	@MpWilli	because if thats the case you should just use a grid framework
2013-10-01 12:17:33	kweaver	yeah, and some of the prebuilt js stuff. im not a fan of foundation buttons
2013-10-01 12:17:33	@MpWilli	and start up your own style library
2013-10-01 12:17:45	jchaike	does anyone use google analytics to send out weekly emails to people?
2013-10-01 12:17:52	kweaver	MpWilli:  you and I still need to do that sometime!
2013-10-01 12:18:30	@MpWilli	i know man
2013-10-01 12:20:09	kweaver	we should pick a weekend, lock ourselves in a room with a cappuccino maker, a couple scarves, and put together a solid, sleek, and light style library
2013-10-01 12:21:29	kweaver	and then modularize it similar to foundation.  need table styling?  pull that shit down.  need a responsive slider?  pull that shit down
2013-10-01 12:22:24	ericmazzola	I'd be down to help out with that Kev
2013-10-01 12:23:57	kweaver	sickkk
2013-10-01 12:24:02	kweaver	yeah the 3 of us should do that
2013-10-01 12:24:23	ericmazzola	I'll actually more-than-likely have some time tonight
2013-10-01 12:24:26	jhartigan	scarves make that so much gayer than it need be
2013-10-01 12:24:40	ericmazzola	Tuesdays and Thursdays would work best for me
2013-10-01 12:24:50	ericmazzola	I'd like to start working on something in my spare time
2013-10-01 12:30:54	jhartigan	oh yo kweaver that cronjob is kicking some ass with the caching
2013-10-01 12:37:48	kweaver	ericmazzola:  I've been using a css file I have called "common.css" that I pull down for every site, and its basically just commonly used stylings.  a bunch of different div shadows, some content div box styles, footer overlay styles, and common stuff like .left{float: left;}
2013-10-01 12:38:26	kweaver	so a few months back MpWilli and I decided that we were going to flesh it way out and build our own style library
2013-10-01 12:38:42	kweaver	with tables, maybe js plugins
2013-10-01 12:38:54	kweaver	accordians
2013-10-01 12:39:00	kweaver	anything we would ever need on a site
2013-10-01 12:39:53	kweaver	all styled to a fluent design
2013-10-01 12:43:16	ericmazzola	nice
2013-10-01 12:43:40	ericmazzola	did you make like a styleguide with it?
2013-10-01 12:43:59	kweaver	that was my plan, but ive been carried away by 10 other things
2013-10-01 12:44:05	ericmazzola	ah word
2013-10-01 12:44:24	kweaver	MpWilli: made a pretty sick styleguide for his orderdeck style library
2013-10-01 12:44:44	ericmazzola	where is that
2013-10-01 12:46:05	kweaver	I dunno, I think it might be somewhere on the backend of orderdeck?
2013-10-01 12:46:13	kweaver	maybe its public facing
2013-10-01 12:46:44	ericmazzola	is orderdeck still happening?
2013-10-01 12:47:08	kweaver	I believe so, but maybe no in the same regard to what you remember
2013-10-01 12:47:17	ericmazzola	ah
2013-10-01 12:48:33	kweaver	it turned into a different project that MpWilli and tommyvyo are working on.  sort of a P2P etsy style platform, only people can request things to be made and have more interaction between seller and buyer
2013-10-01 12:51:44	kweaver	had you heard about that ericmazzola?
2013-10-01 12:56:19	tommyvyo	yo kweaver

2013-10-02 10:36:55	ericmazzola	jhartigan: kweaver_laptop do you guys have a new color scheme you were going for with omni?
2013-10-02 10:37:13	jhartigan	ask the designer.. i just do as im told. i cant make shit pretty
2013-10-02 10:37:34	jhartigan	hes got a nice light pastelish selection of colors going though
2013-10-02 10:37:46	kweaver_laptop	yeah Ive got pretty much everything finished on the design
2013-10-02 10:37:50	kweaver_laptop	in psd at least
2013-10-02 10:38:06	kweaver_laptop	ill send it over tomorrow so you can check it
2013-10-02 10:38:11	ericmazzola	sweet
2013-10-02 10:38:15	kweaver_laptop	then ill be workin on the haml/sass
2013-10-02 10:38:35	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: check out peroxide when you get a chance
2013-10-02 10:39:27	jhartigan	its a theme engine, not so much just haml and sass interpreter
2013-10-02 10:39:38	jhartigan	loooked at her before i left the house this morning
2013-10-02 10:39:55	jhartigan	fucking.. made the mistake of saying oh ill stop at the chicken fila for a quick breakfast
2013-10-02 10:40:02	jhartigan	25min to get a goddamn chicken biscuit
2013-10-02 10:40:28	jhartigan	any reason you want to use peroxide over just haml and sass preprocessing kweaver_laptop
2013-10-02 10:47:41	jspeak	did they ever finsish black mesa?
2013-10-02 10:47:51	kweaver_laptop	I just skimmed over peroxide, and it sounds like it adds haml to the drupal backend as well
2013-10-02 10:48:00	kweaver_laptop	I finished it
2013-10-02 10:48:09	kweaver_laptop	and realized that it wasnt completely done
2013-10-02 10:48:18	kweaver_laptop	you play it jspeak ?
2013-10-02 10:48:18	jhartigan	yeah jspeak i do believe the ending was added.. not 100% sure
2013-10-02 10:48:30	jhartigan	yeah kweaver_laptop it supports haml but its a themeing enging for rolling drupal themes
2013-10-02 10:48:52	jspeak	i played it, but found out that it wasnt finished, so i stopped
2013-10-02 10:48:52	jhartigan	just curious if you had a reason for using it over the sass/haml preprocessing in it
2013-10-02 10:48:55	jhartigan	in the bourbon basic one
2013-10-02 10:52:25	kweaver_laptop	yeah jhartigan  its my understanding that peroxide would be tied into the parent theme and would allow for using haml from the drupal back end
2013-10-02 10:55:16	jhartigan	yeah. but thats also built into the sass api module so i wasnt sure what you wanted peroxide for
2013-10-02 10:55:20	jhartigan	we can switch over no problem though
2013-10-02 10:55:24	jhartigan	ill do that first
2013-10-02 10:55:30	jhartigan	it may make custom theming easier
2013-10-02 10:58:12	tommyvyo	nosir

2013-10-02 10:58:46	tommyvyo	for like work and shit
2013-10-02 10:58:49	kweaver_laptop	in philly?
2013-10-02 10:58:54	tommyvyo	ya
2013-10-02 10:58:56	jhartigan	its both
2013-10-02 10:58:56	kweaver_laptop	ah
2013-10-02 10:58:59	jhartigan	thats pretty ppimp
2013-10-02 10:59:01	kweaver_laptop	thats cool
2013-10-02 10:59:12	tommyvyo	my kind of establishment.
2013-10-02 10:59:14	tommyvyo	4sure.
2013-10-02 10:59:23	kweaver_laptop	there was an awesome coffee/wine bar that danielle and I went to a few times in San Fran
2013-10-02 10:59:29	kweaver_laptop	no idea what thats not a more common idea
2013-10-02 10:59:32	kweaver_laptop	so awesome
2013-10-02 10:59:42	kweaver_laptop	bar at night, coffee in the morn
2013-10-02 11:00:33	matthewspeak	and a place to sleep?
2013-10-02 11:03:22	jhartigan	yeah i guess they become a glorified hotel at that point
2013-10-02 11:03:30	jhartigan	or a less glorified one
2013-10-02 11:03:56	kweaver_laptop	tommyvyo: do you use haml on any of your drupal sites
2013-10-02 11:04:09	jhartigan	i think my laptop battery finally comitted suicide
2013-10-02 11:11:45	tommyvyo	no kweaver_laptop
2013-10-02 11:15:42	jhartigan	i mean i guess the other otopion kweaver_laptop is to roll with straight drupal and just run local test with the haml sass and put the compiled shit in the site
2013-10-02 11:16:01	jhartigan	less drupal fuckery and therefore less module conflicts id assume
2013-10-02 11:16:10	jhartigan	you lemme know what you wanna do

2013-10-02 11:17:28	-->	jchaike (~jchaike@74-92-113-46-Philadelphia.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #orderdeck
2013-10-02 11:17:38	tommyvyo	:D
2013-10-02 11:18:17	jhartigan	hm?
2013-10-02 11:18:22	jhartigan	those would be the two options
2013-10-02 11:19:13	jhartigan	cause at the end of the day its just a bunch of blocks were using for the single page
2013-10-02 11:25:01	jhartigan	okay kweaver_laptop  =(   jk  read all that and lemme know what route i should take though
2013-10-02 11:27:38	kweaver_laptop	you can decide.  the ideal setup is being able to write the theme entirely in haml and being able to edit it on the backend in haml.  if writing it in the backend turns out to be too much of a pain, then I dont mind just writing the initial theme in haml and from there just making modifications in html
2013-10-02 11:28:03	kweaver_laptop	sass is a mos def must
2013-10-02 11:28:14	kweaver_laptop	haml is just quicker initially
2013-10-02 11:28:18	jhartigan	yeah but i think youre confusing theme for what we have
2013-10-02 11:28:21	jhartigan	i think thats the differe nce
2013-10-02 11:28:29	jhartigan	a theme is a multiple page jawnski
2013-10-02 11:28:37	jhartigan	we have one page really with a block for each section
2013-10-02 11:28:59	jhartigan	so i think its probably easier to just have a subtheme of nothing. add all of our css to it and just go with a local haml sass route
2013-10-02 11:29:07	jhartigan	and we can break them into relevant blocks on deploy
2013-10-02 11:29:27	kweaver_laptop	we'll most likely have the main single page, a portfolio page, and a blog section (at some point)
2013-10-02 11:30:21	kweaver_laptop	aight well do whatever you think feels right
2013-10-02 11:30:29	jhartigan	yeah theres two pages really
2013-10-02 11:30:52	jhartigan	and most of that is covered entirely with having a css file, not so much layouts like drupal has and content types
2013-10-02 11:31:21	jhartigan	so i dunno. itll be a content type for the index and a content type for a portfolio entry and one for displaying all portfolio entries
2013-10-02 11:38:04	jhartigan	the other main thing im thinking about with all of this is time kweaver_laptop wether or not we skip over the best newest module might not matter in terms of turn around for a new site
2013-10-02 11:39:56	tommyvyo	damn, rest in peace tom clancy
2013-10-02 11:40:10	kweaver_laptop	yeah def. dont worry about peroxide, we can just write out haml and compile it
2013-10-02 11:40:18	kweaver_laptop	yeah he died pretty young
2013-10-02 11:41:22	jhartigan	yeah i saw that
2013-10-02 11:41:33	jhartigan	nothing about why other than hospital. cancer or something?
2013-10-02 11:41:58	kweaver_laptop	huge fire-fight
2013-10-02 11:42:01	kweaver_laptop	just like in his novels
2013-10-02 11:42:05	jhartigan	alright kweaver_laptop ill yank all of our extensions. create a subtheme and fix up the middlemand and we can just push compiled code to the live site
2013-10-02 11:42:05	jhartigan	lolol gotem

2013-10-02 12:16:51	tommyvyo	I am not sure what a designer or developer do, but I'm sure I need help with a website. and perhaps designing a logo/brand identity. I'm enrolled in my last 2 courses for my first Master's and want to start a business (perhaps eventually a non-profit) to help small businesses with their HR and payroll. Help them centralize the administrative nonsense so they
2013-10-02 12:16:51	tommyvyo	can get back to their business and keep it growing instead of being bogged down. I don't know how long of a message I can leave, but email me and let's work something out. - Nico

2013-10-02 15:14:39	tommyvyo	dunno really depends on what u intend to do with it
2013-10-02 15:15:05	tommyvyo	unless ur hard pressed on riding on the road, i'd recommend a mountain bike
2013-10-02 15:15:24	jhartigan	id be looking more mountain bikey
2013-10-02 15:15:30	jhartigan	id probably ride through wenonah a good bit
2013-10-02 15:15:30	tommyvyo	its really easy to get to ceres park from where you live
2013-10-02 15:15:33	jhartigan	maybe gcc trails
2013-10-02 15:15:36	tommyvyo	gcc trails too
2013-10-02 15:15:45	tommyvyo	you can ride mountain bikes all winter long because there isnt any wind chill in the woods
2013-10-02 15:15:46	jhartigan	but gccs get pretty hairy at certain points haha
2013-10-02 15:15:49	tommyvyo	there are lots of hills
2013-10-02 15:15:54	tommyvyo	only because u lack experience
2013-10-02 15:16:00	jhartigan	yeah for sure
2013-10-02 15:16:11	tommyvyo	it only takes two or three good flips over the handle bars before you start to learn that you should stop flipping over handle bars
2013-10-02 15:16:19	jhartigan	dude i hit that one steep ass hill with the bridge on the short side so fast... and oh man do you come down quick
2013-10-02 15:17:05	tommyvyo	lol
2013-10-02 15:17:37	tommyvyo	i got the homie sam fine into mountain biking, he flipped 3 times on his first trip
2013-10-02 15:17:42	tommyvyo	was terribly slow and annoying to ride with
2013-10-02 15:17:47	tommyvyo	hes been doing it for about a year
2013-10-02 15:17:54	jhartigan	needless to say i ran into a nice bush.. broke my fall with my face though so it was okay
2013-10-02 15:17:55	tommyvyo	rode with him for the first time in a while last month or so and he was droppin' me
2013-10-02 15:30:33	@MpWilli	jhartigan you will also snowboard with me this winter right?
2013-10-02 15:30:52	jhartigan	can i be drunk?

2013-10-02 15:30:57	jhartigan	and only if you surf with me

2013-10-02 15:31:03	ericmazzola	i need to get myself one as well
2013-10-02 15:31:30	@MpWilli	haha yeah you can be drunk! and ill definitely surf with you
2013-10-02 15:32:09	ericmazzola	although i guess i don't need a mountain
2013-10-02 15:33:19	jhartigan	well it looks like we have a deal MpWilli
2013-10-02 15:33:38	@MpWilli	lets kiss on it
2013-10-02 15:34:30	jhartigan	double deal!
2013-10-02 15:36:08	jhartigan	kweaver: this looks alot better now that the layouts getting done.. maybe i should learn how to make things prett one day
2013-10-02 15:37:09	kweaver	yeah I kinda want you to do some of the initial css so that you get a good feel for it
2013-10-02 15:37:48	@MpWilli	kweaver haha that styleguide would help him
2013-10-02 15:37:54	jhartigan	i never feel good about css.. let alone have a good feel for it
2013-10-02 15:37:58	jhartigan	shes such a cold mistress
2013-10-02 15:38:12	jhartigan	i do say that black and white however looks fantastic
2013-10-02 15:38:20	kweaver	a solid 80% of the work in building a custom site is the initial photoshop design, and turning it into html and css
2013-10-02 15:38:21	jhartigan	lets run with this and my placeholder shit
2013-10-02 15:38:25	jhartigan	BIG ASS OMNI IMAGE
2013-10-02 15:38:28	jhartigan	looks great to me
2013-10-02 15:38:45	ericmazzola	^^\
2013-10-02 15:38:52	ericmazzola	what kweaver said
2013-10-02 15:39:13	jhartigan	good thing i cant use photoshop outside the pentool for selections and opacity
2013-10-02 15:39:22	jhartigan	although that martines florist logo
2013-10-02 15:39:25	jhartigan	some of my finest work
2013-10-02 15:39:28	kweaver	yeah dont worry about the photoshop end
2013-10-02 15:39:31	kweaver	that can always be me
2013-10-02 15:39:40	kweaver	but we'll need to start splitting the html/css phase
2013-10-02 15:39:50	jhartigan	i have no problem with html
2013-10-02 15:39:53	jhartigan	that i can do all day
2013-10-02 15:40:13	jhartigan	its his fucking overattached slutty cousin css that doesnt get along well with me
2013-10-02 15:40:48	kweaver	given a solid psd, its not like it requires any sort of creative thinking
2013-10-02 15:41:04	kweaver	just a time consuming process
2013-10-02 15:41:44	jhartigan	i mean laying things out and knowing how to do complex shit with css are v ery different
2013-10-02 15:41:45	kweaver	I have no problem having it as my specialty in the two of us, but I probably shouldnt be the only one equipt for that
2013-10-02 15:42:05	kweaver	yeah the design we have shouldnt involve anything difficult at all
2013-10-02 15:42:34	kweaver	once its set up in foundation, its basically setting div backgrounds and colors
2013-10-02 15:43:12	jhartigan	yeah i mean this will be laid out and id'd / classed properly by the end of the day
2013-10-02 15:43:18	jhartigan	then its just the tweaks and colors
2013-10-02 15:43:21	jhartigan	and font
2013-10-02 15:43:26	jhartigan	and bitches
2013-10-02 15:43:29	jhartigan	there better be bitches
2013-10-02 15:43:43	kweaver	the parallax will be more work than any of the regular css anyway
2013-10-02 15:43:49	ericmazzola	god, i fucking love nectarines
2013-10-02 15:43:54	ericmazzola	i just wish they were more firm

2013-10-02 15:44:30	jhartigan	gimmicks get customers
2013-10-02 15:45:13	ericmazzola	i guess they can
2013-10-02 15:45:38	ericmazzola	parallax sites just rub me the wrong way

2013-10-04 14:08:17	kweaver_laptop	whatd he said?
2013-10-04 14:08:21	@tommyvyo	the guy from ncst
2013-10-04 14:08:27	@tommyvyo	were gonna talk on monday
2013-10-04 14:08:31	kweaver_laptop	cool beans
2013-10-04 14:08:36	kweaver_laptop	def the best way to approach it
2013-10-04 14:09:53	kweaver_laptop	the whole business interaction model is based around this concept:  The more times you talk to them (face to face or on the phone), the more of a relationship you will build, the more they will inherently trust you
2013-10-04 14:10:16	kweaver_laptop	more interactions = more trust
2013-10-04 14:10:44	kweaver_laptop	and thats what you need.  nobody knows that you're actually a super star programmer.  they're used to being ripped off by shit ones
2013-10-04 14:10:54	jhartigan	unless its reddit for hire.. they are afraid to get on the phone
2013-10-04 14:12:59	matthewspeak	i'm trying to make a sale on reddit haha
2013-10-04 14:13:52	jhartigan	last guy i talked to on reddit emailed back and forth
2013-10-04 14:14:12	matthewspeak	a website lead?
2013-10-04 14:14:15	jhartigan	i asked if we could do a conference call and hes was like.. "yeah uh no, id rather just do emails - just ask questions here"
2013-10-04 14:14:24	matthewspeak	oh jeez
2013-10-04 14:14:26	jhartigan	yeah he needed some contract work
2013-10-04 14:14:33	jhartigan	woulda took me a day
2013-10-04 14:14:36	jhartigan	and been good cash
2013-10-04 14:14:47	jhartigan	not wasting my time if you wont get on the phone though
2013-10-04 14:15:10	jhartigan	cant get exactly what i want out of you in email communication. so easy to diagnose issues and set goals with phone interaction

2013-10-07 16:51:14	kweaver_laptop	lol
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	 I am from Rural PA, and moved to NJ..... for unpleasant reasons. Anyway, I'm here. Since moving here I've had several friends who tell me that when they first met me, they thought I was a snob, sarcastic/snide and stuck up; pretend nice. But after getting to know me they realize, that's just how I am. I guess my "country folk" mentality doesn't mesh well
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	with stereotypical cranky NJ.
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	 
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	Authenticity is the most important value to me, personally and professionally. While being from a farm in PA was integral in my development, I try to start off with "well educated, well spoken, congenial" - before the country as F*ck  side. People sometimes get the impression that from the country means not educated but I'm finishing my fist master's
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	starting a second. My sister just got full ride and works for the dept of vocational rehab in pa, and my mom has her master's in special ed and is working on her doctorate, teaching at temple and full ride assistantship.

2013-10-09 10:52:44	ericmazzola	we complete the task and send it back to them

2013-10-09 14:07:32	jchaike	is i386 the same as 32bit?
2013-10-09 14:07:45	jchaike	im trying all these different linux isos and they are all i386 but i need x86
2013-10-09 14:07:59	jchaike	and i might sound like an idiot of i386 and x86 are the same lol
2013-10-09 14:09:12	jhartigan	they are one in the same
2013-10-09 14:09:30	jhartigan	i386 is the shortened name of the x86 architecture
2013-10-09 14:09:39	jhartigan	80386 or something
2013-10-09 14:10:06	jchaike	is it weird that fedora (labelled in the iso dowload as x86) almost works and other distros labelled i386 in the iso dont even attempt to boot, it just straight into windows 8
2013-10-09 14:10:23	jchaike	im thinking its either a gateway thing or a windows 8 thing
2013-10-09 14:11:33	jhartigan	did you disable the security in bios
2013-10-09 14:12:33	jchaike	hmm, i didnt really look for any option like that (im trying to be discrete, a DOS blue screen im afraid draws attention haha) you think that would cause that kind of issue? where the closest ive gotten to any linux booting was the fedora teardrop loading screen and then it fails
2013-10-09 14:13:13	jhartigan	any pc with windows 8 has security settings in its bios/efi that prevent installation
2013-10-09 14:13:15	jhartigan	so yes
2013-10-09 14:13:17	jhartigan	i think thats a problem
2013-10-09 14:13:34	jchaike	oh wow i didnt realize that, cool thanks
2013-10-09 14:13:49	jhartigan	sure thing

2013-10-09 15:39:33	kweaver	wednesday or friday for me
2013-10-09 15:41:21	jhartigan	im thinking we should stop splitting tabs
2013-10-09 15:41:27	jhartigan	it seems much more beneficial if we do
2013-10-09 15:42:28	jspeak	well i like going wednesdays more than fridays
2013-10-09 15:44:27	jhartigan	sames
2013-10-09 15:46:37	kweaver	splitting meaning sharing, or splitting meaning separating?
2013-10-09 15:46:54	jhartigan	splitting meaning separating
2013-10-09 15:46:57	jhartigan	everytime we get one check
2013-10-09 15:47:03	jhartigan	its even cheaper than separate
2013-10-09 15:47:10	kweaver	ew
2013-10-09 15:47:17	kweaver	yeah its double edged
2013-10-09 15:47:22	matthewspeak	they charge you for that?
2013-10-09 15:47:22	kweaver	I think we pay less when we split
2013-10-09 15:47:31	kweaver	nah
2013-10-09 15:47:35	matthewspeak	or ryan just hooks us up?
2013-10-09 15:48:06	kweaver	eh actually i dunno
2013-10-09 15:48:40	jhartigan	i mean we payed more with the girls, but overallll its been even cheaper than split i think when weve ordered together
2013-10-09 15:49:25	kweaver	so far whenever we've split, we dont tip as nicely, because we're looking at a big total and its scary, and we dont want to speak for anyone else with their money
2013-10-09 15:49:34	kweaver	splitting is just a pain in the dick and requires cash
2013-10-09 15:49:39	kweaver	which I almost never have
2013-10-09 15:49:41	kweaver	or want to have
2013-10-09 15:50:03	jspeak	i dont get it, why is it cheaper one way or the other?
2013-10-09 15:50:21	kweaver	well so far, whenever we've split, we've gotten more free shit
2013-10-09 15:50:22	jhartigan	when the checks are split its usually 1 free drink. 2 if youre there for a while
2013-10-09 15:50:43	jspeak	ooh
2013-10-09 15:50:43	jhartigan	when its one check both times kev and i get like mutliple free beers
2013-10-09 15:50:50	jhartigan	even on a shorter trip
2013-10-09 15:52:33	jhartigan	separate checks are still free beers which is legit, but multiple free is even more legit
2013-10-09 15:53:37	kweaver	my biggest peave is cash
2013-10-09 15:54:16	jhartigan	yeah but i suppose tappin the macson on the way isnt bad
2013-10-09 15:54:20	jhartigan	simple also has money sharing now
2013-10-09 15:54:22	jhartigan	btw
2013-10-09 15:54:26	jhartigan	just noticed it last night
2013-10-09 15:58:04	jhartigan	anyways round 5 im gonna do this new workout im trying. took me like 50 min so sometime round 6ish pbs jspeak ?
2013-10-09 15:59:41	@tommyvyo	test it out and share me some money jhartigan
2013-10-09 15:59:53	jhartigan	no you try it with me
2013-10-09 16:00:35	jspeak	sure

2013-10-09 16:02:51	kweaver	jhartigan:  does send money cost anything?
2013-10-09 16:04:32	jhartigan	i didnt go that far.. im gonna assume no, given their no fee structure
2013-10-09 16:04:33	jhartigan	but who knows

2013-10-10 09:28:50	matthewspeak	is it easy to make text images using the google glass font?
2013-10-10 09:29:09	matthewspeak	just like a jpg that says my name, or whatever, in that font

2013-10-10 09:30:50	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-10 09:30:53	ericmazzola	what is it going to be used for?
2013-10-10 09:31:02	ericmazzola	and do you need anything else involved with it?
2013-10-10 09:31:05	matthewspeak	presentation for grad school
2013-10-10 09:31:23	matthewspeak	my name would be cool for the first slide.  but if it's easy, maybe slide titles

2013-10-10 09:32:25	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-10 09:32:51	ericmazzola	http://www.dafont.com/arual.font
2013-10-10 09:32:54	ericmazzola	check that
2013-10-10 09:32:57	ericmazzola	it's free
2013-10-10 09:32:58	ericmazzola	and similar
2013-10-10 09:33:19	ericmazzola	you could just install that font, and use it in your presentation as a title
2013-10-10 09:34:18	ericmazzola	in general, if you can avoid text being rasterized (turned into an image instead of the mathematical formula that governs what the letters look like), you should
2013-10-10 09:34:34	ericmazzola	does that make sense?
2013-10-10 09:34:38	matthewspeak	kinda
2013-10-10 09:34:47	matthewspeak	you're saying text is better than image with text?
2013-10-10 09:35:13	ericmazzola	you're doing it for a powerpoint presentation?
2013-10-10 09:35:25	matthewspeak	yeah
2013-10-10 09:35:46	matthewspeak	well google docs, saved as .ppt or whatever, and running on powerpoint on another computer
2013-10-10 09:35:55	ericmazzola	ohh gotcha
2013-10-10 09:36:05	ericmazzola	so you're worried about the font not working on another computer?
2013-10-10 09:36:17	kweaver1	in thas case, it's probably fine just to rasterize the text into the image
2013-10-10 09:36:17	ericmazzola	because it's not installed on it
2013-10-10 09:36:22	matthewspeak	if i go the text route, yes
2013-10-10 09:36:27	ericmazzola	okayy
2013-10-10 09:36:59	matthewspeak	what's the issue with making it an image?
2013-10-10 09:37:11	ericmazzola	in this particular case, not much
2013-10-10 09:37:24	matthewspeak	ok cool
2013-10-10 09:37:35	kweaver1	mazz is just sayings for best practices

2013-10-10 11:00:48	jhartigan	wtf tommyvyo  youre not kidding the overalpping sessions are insane
2013-10-10 11:00:58	jhartigan	im trying to plan out what i wanna see tomorrow and fucksticks
2013-10-10 11:01:07	@tommyvyo	jfortunato: yessir
2013-10-10 11:01:31	jfortunato	have you used angular?
2013-10-10 11:01:36	@tommyvyo	in regards to using backbone js, i got a ping from u somewhere ^^
2013-10-10 11:02:14	@tommyvyo	ive checked it out very briefly, im waiting a little bit to decide whether i want to use angular, ember, or ext
2013-10-10 11:02:23	jfortunato	word
2013-10-10 11:02:37	jfortunato	im just trying to decide on something
2013-10-10 11:02:48	jfortunato	so i can improve on my jquery spaghetti lol
2013-10-10 11:03:13	jhartigan	write only javascript!
2013-10-10 11:03:39	jfortunato	yea thats an option as well
2013-10-10 11:04:03	jhartigan	i tired it for a bit. problem is it doesnt help much in the areas that jquery alreay improves
2013-10-10 11:04:11	jhartigan	or at least didnt seem to.
2013-10-10 11:04:30	jfortunato	its just the code I write is heavily tied to the DOM
2013-10-10 11:04:32	jhartigan	kweaver1: http://www.drupaldelphia.com/sessions    make a list and lets see what overlaps
2013-10-10 11:04:36	jfortunato	and that needs to improve
2013-10-10 11:10:54	@tommyvyo	jfortunato: have you done anything with backbone yet?
2013-10-10 11:11:11	jfortunato	no just looking at my options
2013-10-10 11:11:20	jfortunato	looking at TodoMVC
2013-10-10 11:11:23	@tommyvyo	word, ember and angular would be good options for large scale web applications
2013-10-10 11:11:30	@tommyvyo	backbone is good for smaller things
2013-10-10 11:12:07	@tommyvyo	also, addy osmani is da man
2013-10-10 11:12:25	jfortunato	thats the todomvc guy right

2013-10-10 14:35:36	@tommyvyo	sitting there like listening to every word, but in my head im behind by 3 words cause im slowly translating and taking best guess shots at what she is saying..
2013-10-10 14:37:15	MpWilli__	hah was she foreign ?

2013-10-10 14:55:10	kweaver	did I tell you 
2013-10-10 14:55:22	kweaver	even if your bitsync folder is on a different partition
2013-10-10 14:55:30	kweaver	it still syncs
2013-10-10 14:55:57	kweaver	remember we were thinking about the best way to set up bitsync on my tiny laptop SSD
2013-10-10 14:56:26	kweaver	and we decided just to put it on the windows HDD, and just let it sync whenever im in windows
2013-10-10 14:57:34	kweaver	makes sense though, as long as the HDD is mounted within linux's control, nothing else should matter

2013-10-10 16:22:12	jhartigan	also the server seems stable at 400mb free kweaver looks like it just uses what it can with cache we just had bad swappiness before
2013-10-10 16:28:23	kweaver1	jhartigan: have you been getting bitsync notifications from everything I do?
2013-10-10 16:28:56	kweaver1	Im downloading all of our ugurus web design sales kit now

Not a great salary but you also get commission on projects that you land, and I've already gotten two raises since I started here less than 8 months ago.
2013-10-14 13:27:25	ericmazzola	We're trying to interview this week so see if you can get in touch with people asap.
