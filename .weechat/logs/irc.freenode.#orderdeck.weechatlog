2013-09-13 13:43:10	jhartigan	yo tommyvyo actually. i was picking my brain the other day.. say someone decided to be a dick and made dns records for a site i hosted on digital ocean as well and had the same nameservers as me
2013-09-13 13:43:23	jhartigan	who gets priority and proof of ownership?
2013-09-13 13:44:48	jchaike	jhartigan,  wouldnt that be an issue anywhere, not just digital ocean?
2013-09-13 13:44:56	jchaike	+ isnt your domain registered under your name, which so is digital ocean, for proof
2013-09-13 13:44:57	jhartigan	yeah
2013-09-13 13:45:19	jhartigan	its an issue anywhere someone has the same dns with the nameservers pointing to the same domain
2013-09-13 13:45:25	jhartigan	im just curious as to how its resolved
2013-09-13 13:45:29	jchaike	is that how domains get "HIJACKED"
2013-09-13 13:45:30	jchaike	lol

2013-09-13 14:08:26	jhartigan	so it wouldnt let me add the same domain if its already on that nameserver?
2013-09-13 14:08:52	tommyvyo	yea
2013-09-13 14:09:29	jhartigan	well i suppose that makes sense then
2013-09-13 14:09:36	jhartigan	didnt think itd be that simple haha
2013-09-13 14:10:50	tommyvyo	i dont think thats how domains get hijacked either
2013-09-13 14:13:12	tommyvyo	i think a few years ago, it might have been cloudfront or some other NY based startup got their domain hijacked from some kid in california and he did it by impersonating security questions on a cell phone account and then changing the nameservers
2013-09-13 14:20:43	jhartigan	guys can i has favor

2013-09-13 16:43:13	jchaike	this is the  "math problem" i got something on sale for 12.50. It was on sale for 50% off. What was the original price? Write a formula to find the original price independent of the discount

2013-09-13 16:44:13	tommyvyo	lol jchaike
2013-09-13 16:44:18	tommyvyo	javascript does weird shit with integers
2013-09-13 16:44:30	jchaike	i did jquery Number(
2013-09-13 16:45:06	jchaike	var ourprice = $(".product-price-value").text();
2013-09-13 16:45:06	jchaike	ourprice=Number(ourprice.replace(/[^0-9\.]+/g,""));
2013-09-13 16:45:19	jchaike	(because it has a $$ in it)
2013-09-13 16:46:15	jharty	well .5(original) = 12.5
2013-09-13 16:46:27	jharty	so 12.5/.5 would be the math
2013-09-13 16:46:45	jchaike	fuck me. thank you jharty  lmfao
2013-09-13 16:46:55	jharty	work retail
2013-09-13 16:47:00	jharty	percentages are cake after that
2013-09-13 16:47:22	jchaike	no i did lmfao, i know HOW to do it... just javascript was giving me answers taht were off by like .10 each time
2013-09-13 16:47:23	jchaike	it was weird
2013-09-13 16:47:29	jchaike	i think my formula was overcomplicated lol
2013-09-13 16:47:35	jharty	cause js isnt staticly typed
2013-09-13 16:47:42	jharty	im not js expert so youd have t look into it
2013-09-13 16:48:04	jharty	probably specify a set number of places after the decimal, namely two, and always to use cieling for the third after it
2013-09-13 16:48:07	jharty	thats my guess anyway
2013-09-13 16:48:31	jchaike	yeah i gotta lok into why js is shit lol thakns jharty
2013-09-13 16:48:51	jharty	alsooo...
2013-09-13 16:49:15	jharty	if youre calculating pricing with js someone could spoof it and potentially send a form with a pirce they set
2013-09-13 16:49:20	jharty	depending on how your shit works
2013-09-13 16:50:37	jchaike	nah its not even for that. theres the list price and "our price" and the our price is crossed off to show you how great of a sale youre getting, and they want it to update live
2013-09-13 16:50:48	jchaike	so its like dynamically updated for a static piece of text
2013-09-13 16:50:49	jchaike	lol
2013-09-13 16:52:44	jharty	thats cool.  just dont want someone spoofing an ajax request and getting shit for pennies
2013-09-13 16:53:46	jchaike	true haha, i'm pretty certain the "list price" is completely independent from the form thats submitted when its added to the car, but ill double check with epople to get myself covered lol

2013-09-17 13:07:30	@tommyvyo	dudes getting a 404 from a server that quite clearly isnt yours, because www.landistitle.com/fuckoffkindly.com is not the same 404

2013-09-17 13:14:25	dtriley4	madness
2013-09-17 13:23:38	kweaver	The weird thing is that whatever dns issue he has, he's claiming that he couldnt access it from home either
2013-09-17 13:24:00	kweaver	he was probably just vps'ing from home though
2013-09-17 13:24:12	kweaver	vpn'ing**

2013-09-17 13:29:19	kweaver	could you imagine two dudes ramming their dicks in your arm pits from behind you?
2013-09-17 13:29:32	kweaver	each way you look, another dick
2013-09-17 13:30:19	kweaver	you can only close your eyes, because even looking forward you see them in your peripheral vision

2013-09-17 15:54:33	erockmazz	and won't leak light
2013-09-17 15:54:43	erockmazz	kweaver: you're daring
2013-09-17 15:54:55	erockmazz	AG isn't very easy
2013-09-17 15:55:22	kweaver_laptop	yeah thats why our last batch didnt turn out very well
2013-09-17 15:55:32	kweaver_laptop	but we wanted to skip right to it
2013-09-17 15:55:32	erockmazz	i did my first partial two weekends ago
2013-09-17 15:55:42	erockmazz	excited to see how that turns out
2013-09-17 15:55:50	erockmazz	I figure I'll do a few partials before doing AG
2013-09-17 15:56:10	erockmazz	you guys should probably have done a few more extracts until they started to turn out good
2013-09-17 15:56:14	@tommyvyo	fuck
2013-09-17 15:56:18	@tommyvyo	im making my own beer too
2013-09-17 15:56:21	erockmazz	so you can narrow down what the issues are
2013-09-17 15:56:47	erockmazz	but more power to you for jumping right in headfirst lol
2013-09-17 15:57:45	erockmazz	it's just that so many different things can impact your outcome - it's hard to narrow down issues when you're doing AG
2013-09-17 15:57:52	erockmazz	by the way
2013-09-17 15:58:07	dtriley4	haha

2013-09-17 16:03:17	erockmazz	i have to assume at least 24
2013-09-17 16:03:36	erockmazz	it was a clone of Surly Furious IPA
2013-09-17 16:03:40	matthewspeak	most recent IPA batch that you had you the party?
2013-09-17 16:03:42	erockmazz	nope
2013-09-17 16:03:52	erockmazz	this one used like 5 different kinds of hops
2013-09-17 16:03:59	erockmazz	and was a lot more involved
2013-09-17 16:04:07	matthewspeak	jam
2013-09-17 16:04:07	erockmazz	dry hopped with 5 oz
2013-09-17 16:04:14	erockmazz	the one at the party was dry hopped with 1 oz
2013-09-17 16:04:19	erockmazz	and brewed with 2
2013-09-17 16:04:36	erockmazz	the new one was dry hopped with 5 and brewed with 1.5
2013-09-17 16:04:48	erockmazz	so it should be a hop kick to the face
2013-09-17 16:05:07	dtriley4	plus those are best enjoyed now while it is a little warm

2013-09-18 00:36:38	kweaver	yeah
2013-09-18 00:37:39	kweaver	so currently you have everything through go daddy right?

2013-09-18 00:38:42	kweaver	so yeah, just add mx records to point to go daddy
2013-09-18 00:38:47	jchaike	but when i try to add a new MX record, it tells me Data needs to end with a dot (.)
2013-09-18 00:39:04	kweaver	yeah you just need a period at the end of the url
2013-09-18 00:39:05	jchaike	but according to go daddy when i called up + on their site, its mailstore1.secureserver.net
2013-09-18 00:39:08	jchaike	oh lol
2013-09-18 00:39:17	kweaver	mailstore1.secureserver.net.

2013-10-01 10:35:14	matthewspeak	if at all
2013-10-01 10:37:53	kweaver	national parks are the tough ones though.  I imagine running one as big as yosemite has to involve some pretty serious overhead
2013-10-01 10:38:06	matthewspeak	true
2013-10-01 10:38:07	kweaver	I dont know the stats, but I imagine the us government is eating some of that cost

2013-10-01 10:42:54	jhartigan	one wrong breeze or a douchebag bird
2013-10-01 10:42:58	jhartigan	and you probably lose life
2013-10-01 10:46:12	matthewspeak	public institutions should keep tabs on who uses them then bill those users at the end of the year.  as a non-profit entity the prices would be lower then private entities that seek to turn a profit.  this would eliminate the need to force 99% of the population who would never even visit yosemite park, to pay for them.

2013-10-01 11:45:13	@MpWilli	just because they use less doesnt mean you have to
2013-10-01 11:45:13	kweaver	so if you want a framework built off sass, why not just use foundation?
2013-10-01 11:45:22	@MpWilli	all i do is add bootstrap.min.css
2013-10-01 11:45:28	@MpWilli	and then have my own stylesheet
2013-10-01 11:45:51	jhartigan	your moms a stylesheet

2013-10-01 11:46:21	kweaver	I know they added small

2013-10-01 11:55:40	tommyvyo	Yea I'm down for that
2013-10-01 11:55:59	jchaike	can i haz GM Mavericks yet? Multi monitor support exists and I CANT HAVE IT YET its KILLING ME
2013-10-01 11:56:36	jchaike	</rant>
2013-10-01 11:56:49	jchaike	sup everyone? MpWilli drkyro ericmazzola jfortunato jhartigan jspeak Koreanderson kweaver kweaver_laptop matthewspeak tommyvyo
2013-10-01 11:56:51	kweaver	can you explain  what maverick's adds for multi monitor support again?
2013-10-01 11:56:56	matthewspeak	no you're not mark cuban
2013-10-01 11:57:07	kweaver	I didnt understand during the press release
2013-10-01 11:57:22	jchaike	basically Mountain Lion and Lion have had full screen apps
2013-10-01 11:57:25	jchaike	but if you have dual monitors
2013-10-01 11:57:34	jchaike	it takes up one full screen, and the other monitor is null
2013-10-01 11:57:57	jchaike	kweaver this is my iTunes in full screen, with both monitors
2013-10-01 11:57:58	jchaike	https://www.dropbox.com/s/z46sq0dr8m9v095/Screenshot%202013-10-01%2011.57.43.png

2013-10-01 11:58:29	kweaver	full screen, meaning when you maximize a window?
2013-10-01 11:58:42	kweaver	or is it different than that
2013-10-01 11:58:44	jchaike	nah this is slightly different
2013-10-01 11:58:58	jchaike	its like a "virtual desktop" window
2013-10-01 11:59:01	jchaike	and its on its own
2013-10-01 11:59:13	jchaike	its like the idea of windows 8 with the full screen apps
2013-10-01 11:59:28	jchaike	they aren't maximized… it is just that single window taking up all aspects of your monitor
2013-10-01 11:59:34	kweaver	okay
2013-10-01 11:59:38	kweaver	I guess that makes sense
2013-10-01 11:59:38	jchaike	whereas a maximized app on Mac still leaves the status bar, and the dock visible
2013-10-01 11:59:51	jchaike	but now with Mavericks you can switch virtual desktops per monitor
2013-10-01 11:59:57	jchaike	rather than swipe desktops and it switches it for both monitors
2013-10-01 12:00:04	jchaike	so its like 2^n desktops lol
2013-10-01 12:02:45	jhartigan	kweaver:  i just read most of that and its very thorough
2013-10-01 12:02:59	jhartigan	everything i like about foundation backs it up
2013-10-01 12:03:11	kweaver	yeah jhartigan
2013-10-01 12:03:15	jhartigan	but the bootstrap 3 syntax
2013-10-01 12:03:28	jhartigan	is some fucking chocolatey mess of an idea
2013-10-01 12:03:30	kweaver	oh man, yeah I didnt see the syntax until just now.
2013-10-01 12:03:42	kweaver	lets remove as many letters as we can
2013-10-01 12:03:43	kweaver	go
2013-10-01 12:03:58	jhartigan	serioulsy
2013-10-01 12:04:08	jhartigan	im surprised it wasnt c-m-4
2013-10-01 12:04:16	kweaver	cm4
2013-10-01 12:04:18	kweaver	no dashes
2013-10-01 12:04:24	kweaver	no room for dashes
2013-10-01 12:04:41	kweaver	cn4   because  n is smaller than an m
2013-10-01 12:09:08	jhartigan	dude the comments on this comparison are amazing
2013-10-01 12:09:18	Koreanderson	i'm reading it now too
2013-10-01 12:09:36	jhartigan	"this is not a good review. You highly favored foundation. I suggest looking at another review which is fair not biased."
2013-10-01 12:11:25	kweaver	lolol
2013-10-01 12:11:27	kweaver	nice
2013-10-01 12:11:47	kweaver	I dont know how you could go over them more thoroughly
2013-10-01 12:12:33	jhartigan	yeah thats my thing. if you dont agree with his opinion thats fine, but its not bias, its his opinionated review
2013-10-01 12:15:05	@MpWilli	kweaver and jhartigan what are you guys doing right now? is this for a new site that youre working on
2013-10-01 12:15:11	@MpWilli	havent you been using bootstrap?
2013-10-01 12:15:28	kweaver	nah we've been using foundation for previous sites
2013-10-01 12:15:36	ericmazzola	they're too cool for bootstrap
2013-10-01 12:15:36	kweaver	and yeah, thisll be for our new site
2013-10-01 12:15:37	ericmazzola	;)
2013-10-01 12:15:38	jhartigan	i havent used bootstrap in forever
2013-10-01 12:15:47	@MpWilli	i honestly would not go to bs3
2013-10-01 12:15:56	@MpWilli	because that syntax is fucking gross!
2013-10-01 12:16:07	kweaver	yeah that alone is a good reason
2013-10-01 12:16:21	kweaver	but that article pretty much spelled out all the other reasons
2013-10-01 12:16:28	@MpWilli	like shit man. that is the most unsemantic thing ive seen in a long time
2013-10-01 12:16:40	jhartigan	its just fucking stupid too
2013-10-01 12:16:41	@MpWilli	however bootstrap does support ie8
2013-10-01 12:16:42	kweaver	I have to say, I wish foundation had half the community supoort that bootstrap had
2013-10-01 12:17:03	kweaver	and I dont really know why they dont
2013-10-01 12:17:11	@MpWilli	kweaver are you just using it for the grid?
2013-10-01 12:17:26	@MpWilli	because if thats the case you should just use a grid framework
2013-10-01 12:17:33	kweaver	yeah, and some of the prebuilt js stuff. im not a fan of foundation buttons
2013-10-01 12:17:33	@MpWilli	and start up your own style library
2013-10-01 12:17:45	jchaike	does anyone use google analytics to send out weekly emails to people?
2013-10-01 12:17:52	kweaver	MpWilli:  you and I still need to do that sometime!
2013-10-01 12:18:30	@MpWilli	i know man
2013-10-01 12:20:09	kweaver	we should pick a weekend, lock ourselves in a room with a cappuccino maker, a couple scarves, and put together a solid, sleek, and light style library
2013-10-01 12:21:29	kweaver	and then modularize it similar to foundation.  need table styling?  pull that shit down.  need a responsive slider?  pull that shit down
2013-10-01 12:22:24	ericmazzola	I'd be down to help out with that Kev
2013-10-01 12:23:57	kweaver	sickkk
2013-10-01 12:24:02	kweaver	yeah the 3 of us should do that
2013-10-01 12:24:23	ericmazzola	I'll actually more-than-likely have some time tonight
2013-10-01 12:24:26	jhartigan	scarves make that so much gayer than it need be
2013-10-01 12:24:40	ericmazzola	Tuesdays and Thursdays would work best for me
2013-10-01 12:24:50	ericmazzola	I'd like to start working on something in my spare time
2013-10-01 12:30:54	jhartigan	oh yo kweaver that cronjob is kicking some ass with the caching
2013-10-01 12:37:48	kweaver	ericmazzola:  I've been using a css file I have called "common.css" that I pull down for every site, and its basically just commonly used stylings.  a bunch of different div shadows, some content div box styles, footer overlay styles, and common stuff like .left{float: left;}
2013-10-01 12:38:26	kweaver	so a few months back MpWilli and I decided that we were going to flesh it way out and build our own style library
2013-10-01 12:38:42	kweaver	with tables, maybe js plugins
2013-10-01 12:38:54	kweaver	accordians
2013-10-01 12:39:00	kweaver	anything we would ever need on a site
2013-10-01 12:39:53	kweaver	all styled to a fluent design
2013-10-01 12:43:16	ericmazzola	nice
2013-10-01 12:43:40	ericmazzola	did you make like a styleguide with it?
2013-10-01 12:43:59	kweaver	that was my plan, but ive been carried away by 10 other things
2013-10-01 12:44:05	ericmazzola	ah word
2013-10-01 12:44:24	kweaver	MpWilli: made a pretty sick styleguide for his orderdeck style library
2013-10-01 12:44:44	ericmazzola	where is that
2013-10-01 12:46:05	kweaver	I dunno, I think it might be somewhere on the backend of orderdeck?
2013-10-01 12:46:13	kweaver	maybe its public facing
2013-10-01 12:46:44	ericmazzola	is orderdeck still happening?
2013-10-01 12:47:08	kweaver	I believe so, but maybe no in the same regard to what you remember
2013-10-01 12:47:17	ericmazzola	ah
2013-10-01 12:48:33	kweaver	it turned into a different project that MpWilli and tommyvyo are working on.  sort of a P2P etsy style platform, only people can request things to be made and have more interaction between seller and buyer
2013-10-01 12:51:44	kweaver	had you heard about that ericmazzola?
2013-10-01 12:56:19	tommyvyo	yo kweaver

2013-10-02 10:36:55	ericmazzola	jhartigan: kweaver_laptop do you guys have a new color scheme you were going for with omni?
2013-10-02 10:37:13	jhartigan	ask the designer.. i just do as im told. i cant make shit pretty
2013-10-02 10:37:34	jhartigan	hes got a nice light pastelish selection of colors going though
2013-10-02 10:37:46	kweaver_laptop	yeah Ive got pretty much everything finished on the design
2013-10-02 10:37:50	kweaver_laptop	in psd at least
2013-10-02 10:38:06	kweaver_laptop	ill send it over tomorrow so you can check it
2013-10-02 10:38:11	ericmazzola	sweet
2013-10-02 10:38:15	kweaver_laptop	then ill be workin on the haml/sass
2013-10-02 10:38:35	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: check out peroxide when you get a chance
2013-10-02 10:39:27	jhartigan	its a theme engine, not so much just haml and sass interpreter
2013-10-02 10:39:38	jhartigan	loooked at her before i left the house this morning
2013-10-02 10:39:55	jhartigan	fucking.. made the mistake of saying oh ill stop at the chicken fila for a quick breakfast
2013-10-02 10:40:02	jhartigan	25min to get a goddamn chicken biscuit
2013-10-02 10:40:28	jhartigan	any reason you want to use peroxide over just haml and sass preprocessing kweaver_laptop
2013-10-02 10:47:41	jspeak	did they ever finsish black mesa?
2013-10-02 10:47:51	kweaver_laptop	I just skimmed over peroxide, and it sounds like it adds haml to the drupal backend as well
2013-10-02 10:48:00	kweaver_laptop	I finished it
2013-10-02 10:48:09	kweaver_laptop	and realized that it wasnt completely done
2013-10-02 10:48:18	kweaver_laptop	you play it jspeak ?
2013-10-02 10:48:18	jhartigan	yeah jspeak i do believe the ending was added.. not 100% sure
2013-10-02 10:48:30	jhartigan	yeah kweaver_laptop it supports haml but its a themeing enging for rolling drupal themes
2013-10-02 10:48:52	jspeak	i played it, but found out that it wasnt finished, so i stopped
2013-10-02 10:48:52	jhartigan	just curious if you had a reason for using it over the sass/haml preprocessing in it
2013-10-02 10:48:55	jhartigan	in the bourbon basic one
2013-10-02 10:52:25	kweaver_laptop	yeah jhartigan  its my understanding that peroxide would be tied into the parent theme and would allow for using haml from the drupal back end
2013-10-02 10:55:16	jhartigan	yeah. but thats also built into the sass api module so i wasnt sure what you wanted peroxide for
2013-10-02 10:55:20	jhartigan	we can switch over no problem though
2013-10-02 10:55:24	jhartigan	ill do that first
2013-10-02 10:55:30	jhartigan	it may make custom theming easier
2013-10-02 10:58:12	tommyvyo	nosir

2013-10-02 10:58:46	tommyvyo	for like work and shit
2013-10-02 10:58:49	kweaver_laptop	in philly?
2013-10-02 10:58:54	tommyvyo	ya
2013-10-02 10:58:56	jhartigan	its both
2013-10-02 10:58:56	kweaver_laptop	ah
2013-10-02 10:58:59	jhartigan	thats pretty ppimp
2013-10-02 10:59:01	kweaver_laptop	thats cool
2013-10-02 10:59:12	tommyvyo	my kind of establishment.
2013-10-02 10:59:14	tommyvyo	4sure.
2013-10-02 10:59:23	kweaver_laptop	there was an awesome coffee/wine bar that danielle and I went to a few times in San Fran
2013-10-02 10:59:29	kweaver_laptop	no idea what thats not a more common idea
2013-10-02 10:59:32	kweaver_laptop	so awesome
2013-10-02 10:59:42	kweaver_laptop	bar at night, coffee in the morn
2013-10-02 11:00:33	matthewspeak	and a place to sleep?
2013-10-02 11:03:22	jhartigan	yeah i guess they become a glorified hotel at that point
2013-10-02 11:03:30	jhartigan	or a less glorified one
2013-10-02 11:03:56	kweaver_laptop	tommyvyo: do you use haml on any of your drupal sites
2013-10-02 11:04:09	jhartigan	i think my laptop battery finally comitted suicide
2013-10-02 11:11:45	tommyvyo	no kweaver_laptop
2013-10-02 11:15:42	jhartigan	i mean i guess the other otopion kweaver_laptop is to roll with straight drupal and just run local test with the haml sass and put the compiled shit in the site
2013-10-02 11:16:01	jhartigan	less drupal fuckery and therefore less module conflicts id assume
2013-10-02 11:16:10	jhartigan	you lemme know what you wanna do

2013-10-02 11:17:28	-->	jchaike (~jchaike@74-92-113-46-Philadelphia.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #orderdeck
2013-10-02 11:17:38	tommyvyo	:D
2013-10-02 11:18:17	jhartigan	hm?
2013-10-02 11:18:22	jhartigan	those would be the two options
2013-10-02 11:19:13	jhartigan	cause at the end of the day its just a bunch of blocks were using for the single page
2013-10-02 11:25:01	jhartigan	okay kweaver_laptop  =(   jk  read all that and lemme know what route i should take though
2013-10-02 11:27:38	kweaver_laptop	you can decide.  the ideal setup is being able to write the theme entirely in haml and being able to edit it on the backend in haml.  if writing it in the backend turns out to be too much of a pain, then I dont mind just writing the initial theme in haml and from there just making modifications in html
2013-10-02 11:28:03	kweaver_laptop	sass is a mos def must
2013-10-02 11:28:14	kweaver_laptop	haml is just quicker initially
2013-10-02 11:28:18	jhartigan	yeah but i think youre confusing theme for what we have
2013-10-02 11:28:21	jhartigan	i think thats the differe nce
2013-10-02 11:28:29	jhartigan	a theme is a multiple page jawnski
2013-10-02 11:28:37	jhartigan	we have one page really with a block for each section
2013-10-02 11:28:59	jhartigan	so i think its probably easier to just have a subtheme of nothing. add all of our css to it and just go with a local haml sass route
2013-10-02 11:29:07	jhartigan	and we can break them into relevant blocks on deploy
2013-10-02 11:29:27	kweaver_laptop	we'll most likely have the main single page, a portfolio page, and a blog section (at some point)
2013-10-02 11:30:21	kweaver_laptop	aight well do whatever you think feels right
2013-10-02 11:30:29	jhartigan	yeah theres two pages really
2013-10-02 11:30:52	jhartigan	and most of that is covered entirely with having a css file, not so much layouts like drupal has and content types
2013-10-02 11:31:21	jhartigan	so i dunno. itll be a content type for the index and a content type for a portfolio entry and one for displaying all portfolio entries
2013-10-02 11:38:04	jhartigan	the other main thing im thinking about with all of this is time kweaver_laptop wether or not we skip over the best newest module might not matter in terms of turn around for a new site
2013-10-02 11:39:56	tommyvyo	damn, rest in peace tom clancy
2013-10-02 11:40:10	kweaver_laptop	yeah def. dont worry about peroxide, we can just write out haml and compile it
2013-10-02 11:40:18	kweaver_laptop	yeah he died pretty young
2013-10-02 11:41:22	jhartigan	yeah i saw that
2013-10-02 11:41:33	jhartigan	nothing about why other than hospital. cancer or something?
2013-10-02 11:41:58	kweaver_laptop	huge fire-fight
2013-10-02 11:42:01	kweaver_laptop	just like in his novels
2013-10-02 11:42:05	jhartigan	alright kweaver_laptop ill yank all of our extensions. create a subtheme and fix up the middlemand and we can just push compiled code to the live site
2013-10-02 11:42:05	jhartigan	lolol gotem

2013-10-02 12:16:51	tommyvyo	I am not sure what a designer or developer do, but I'm sure I need help with a website. and perhaps designing a logo/brand identity. I'm enrolled in my last 2 courses for my first Master's and want to start a business (perhaps eventually a non-profit) to help small businesses with their HR and payroll. Help them centralize the administrative nonsense so they
2013-10-02 12:16:51	tommyvyo	can get back to their business and keep it growing instead of being bogged down. I don't know how long of a message I can leave, but email me and let's work something out. - Nico

2013-10-02 15:14:39	tommyvyo	dunno really depends on what u intend to do with it
2013-10-02 15:15:05	tommyvyo	unless ur hard pressed on riding on the road, i'd recommend a mountain bike
2013-10-02 15:15:24	jhartigan	id be looking more mountain bikey
2013-10-02 15:15:30	jhartigan	id probably ride through wenonah a good bit
2013-10-02 15:15:30	tommyvyo	its really easy to get to ceres park from where you live
2013-10-02 15:15:33	jhartigan	maybe gcc trails
2013-10-02 15:15:36	tommyvyo	gcc trails too
2013-10-02 15:15:45	tommyvyo	you can ride mountain bikes all winter long because there isnt any wind chill in the woods
2013-10-02 15:15:46	jhartigan	but gccs get pretty hairy at certain points haha
2013-10-02 15:15:49	tommyvyo	there are lots of hills
2013-10-02 15:15:54	tommyvyo	only because u lack experience
2013-10-02 15:16:00	jhartigan	yeah for sure
2013-10-02 15:16:11	tommyvyo	it only takes two or three good flips over the handle bars before you start to learn that you should stop flipping over handle bars
2013-10-02 15:16:19	jhartigan	dude i hit that one steep ass hill with the bridge on the short side so fast... and oh man do you come down quick
2013-10-02 15:17:05	tommyvyo	lol
2013-10-02 15:17:37	tommyvyo	i got the homie sam fine into mountain biking, he flipped 3 times on his first trip
2013-10-02 15:17:42	tommyvyo	was terribly slow and annoying to ride with
2013-10-02 15:17:47	tommyvyo	hes been doing it for about a year
2013-10-02 15:17:54	jhartigan	needless to say i ran into a nice bush.. broke my fall with my face though so it was okay
2013-10-02 15:17:55	tommyvyo	rode with him for the first time in a while last month or so and he was droppin' me
2013-10-02 15:30:33	@MpWilli	jhartigan you will also snowboard with me this winter right?
2013-10-02 15:30:52	jhartigan	can i be drunk?

2013-10-02 15:30:57	jhartigan	and only if you surf with me

2013-10-02 15:31:03	ericmazzola	i need to get myself one as well
2013-10-02 15:31:30	@MpWilli	haha yeah you can be drunk! and ill definitely surf with you
2013-10-02 15:32:09	ericmazzola	although i guess i don't need a mountain
2013-10-02 15:33:19	jhartigan	well it looks like we have a deal MpWilli
2013-10-02 15:33:38	@MpWilli	lets kiss on it
2013-10-02 15:34:30	jhartigan	double deal!
2013-10-02 15:36:08	jhartigan	kweaver: this looks alot better now that the layouts getting done.. maybe i should learn how to make things prett one day
2013-10-02 15:37:09	kweaver	yeah I kinda want you to do some of the initial css so that you get a good feel for it
2013-10-02 15:37:48	@MpWilli	kweaver haha that styleguide would help him
2013-10-02 15:37:54	jhartigan	i never feel good about css.. let alone have a good feel for it
2013-10-02 15:37:58	jhartigan	shes such a cold mistress
2013-10-02 15:38:12	jhartigan	i do say that black and white however looks fantastic
2013-10-02 15:38:20	kweaver	a solid 80% of the work in building a custom site is the initial photoshop design, and turning it into html and css
2013-10-02 15:38:21	jhartigan	lets run with this and my placeholder shit
2013-10-02 15:38:25	jhartigan	BIG ASS OMNI IMAGE
2013-10-02 15:38:28	jhartigan	looks great to me
2013-10-02 15:38:45	ericmazzola	^^\
2013-10-02 15:38:52	ericmazzola	what kweaver said
2013-10-02 15:39:13	jhartigan	good thing i cant use photoshop outside the pentool for selections and opacity
2013-10-02 15:39:22	jhartigan	although that martines florist logo
2013-10-02 15:39:25	jhartigan	some of my finest work
2013-10-02 15:39:28	kweaver	yeah dont worry about the photoshop end
2013-10-02 15:39:31	kweaver	that can always be me
2013-10-02 15:39:40	kweaver	but we'll need to start splitting the html/css phase
2013-10-02 15:39:50	jhartigan	i have no problem with html
2013-10-02 15:39:53	jhartigan	that i can do all day
2013-10-02 15:40:13	jhartigan	its his fucking overattached slutty cousin css that doesnt get along well with me
2013-10-02 15:40:48	kweaver	given a solid psd, its not like it requires any sort of creative thinking
2013-10-02 15:41:04	kweaver	just a time consuming process
2013-10-02 15:41:44	jhartigan	i mean laying things out and knowing how to do complex shit with css are v ery different
2013-10-02 15:41:45	kweaver	I have no problem having it as my specialty in the two of us, but I probably shouldnt be the only one equipt for that
2013-10-02 15:42:05	kweaver	yeah the design we have shouldnt involve anything difficult at all
2013-10-02 15:42:34	kweaver	once its set up in foundation, its basically setting div backgrounds and colors
2013-10-02 15:43:12	jhartigan	yeah i mean this will be laid out and id'd / classed properly by the end of the day
2013-10-02 15:43:18	jhartigan	then its just the tweaks and colors
2013-10-02 15:43:21	jhartigan	and font
2013-10-02 15:43:26	jhartigan	and bitches
2013-10-02 15:43:29	jhartigan	there better be bitches
2013-10-02 15:43:43	kweaver	the parallax will be more work than any of the regular css anyway
2013-10-02 15:43:49	ericmazzola	god, i fucking love nectarines
2013-10-02 15:43:54	ericmazzola	i just wish they were more firm

2013-10-02 15:44:30	jhartigan	gimmicks get customers
2013-10-02 15:45:13	ericmazzola	i guess they can
2013-10-02 15:45:38	ericmazzola	parallax sites just rub me the wrong way

2013-10-04 14:08:17	kweaver_laptop	whatd he said?
2013-10-04 14:08:21	@tommyvyo	the guy from ncst
2013-10-04 14:08:27	@tommyvyo	were gonna talk on monday
2013-10-04 14:08:31	kweaver_laptop	cool beans
2013-10-04 14:08:36	kweaver_laptop	def the best way to approach it
2013-10-04 14:09:53	kweaver_laptop	the whole business interaction model is based around this concept:  The more times you talk to them (face to face or on the phone), the more of a relationship you will build, the more they will inherently trust you
2013-10-04 14:10:16	kweaver_laptop	more interactions = more trust
2013-10-04 14:10:44	kweaver_laptop	and thats what you need.  nobody knows that you're actually a super star programmer.  they're used to being ripped off by shit ones
2013-10-04 14:10:54	jhartigan	unless its reddit for hire.. they are afraid to get on the phone
2013-10-04 14:12:59	matthewspeak	i'm trying to make a sale on reddit haha
2013-10-04 14:13:52	jhartigan	last guy i talked to on reddit emailed back and forth
2013-10-04 14:14:12	matthewspeak	a website lead?
2013-10-04 14:14:15	jhartigan	i asked if we could do a conference call and hes was like.. "yeah uh no, id rather just do emails - just ask questions here"
2013-10-04 14:14:24	matthewspeak	oh jeez
2013-10-04 14:14:26	jhartigan	yeah he needed some contract work
2013-10-04 14:14:33	jhartigan	woulda took me a day
2013-10-04 14:14:36	jhartigan	and been good cash
2013-10-04 14:14:47	jhartigan	not wasting my time if you wont get on the phone though
2013-10-04 14:15:10	jhartigan	cant get exactly what i want out of you in email communication. so easy to diagnose issues and set goals with phone interaction

2013-10-07 16:51:14	kweaver_laptop	lol
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	 I am from Rural PA, and moved to NJ..... for unpleasant reasons. Anyway, I'm here. Since moving here I've had several friends who tell me that when they first met me, they thought I was a snob, sarcastic/snide and stuck up; pretend nice. But after getting to know me they realize, that's just how I am. I guess my "country folk" mentality doesn't mesh well
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	with stereotypical cranky NJ.
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	 
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	Authenticity is the most important value to me, personally and professionally. While being from a farm in PA was integral in my development, I try to start off with "well educated, well spoken, congenial" - before the country as F*ck  side. People sometimes get the impression that from the country means not educated but I'm finishing my fist master's
2013-10-07 16:51:30	@tommyvyo	starting a second. My sister just got full ride and works for the dept of vocational rehab in pa, and my mom has her master's in special ed and is working on her doctorate, teaching at temple and full ride assistantship.

2013-10-09 10:52:44	ericmazzola	we complete the task and send it back to them

2013-10-09 14:07:32	jchaike	is i386 the same as 32bit?
2013-10-09 14:07:45	jchaike	im trying all these different linux isos and they are all i386 but i need x86
2013-10-09 14:07:59	jchaike	and i might sound like an idiot of i386 and x86 are the same lol
2013-10-09 14:09:12	jhartigan	they are one in the same
2013-10-09 14:09:30	jhartigan	i386 is the shortened name of the x86 architecture
2013-10-09 14:09:39	jhartigan	80386 or something
2013-10-09 14:10:06	jchaike	is it weird that fedora (labelled in the iso dowload as x86) almost works and other distros labelled i386 in the iso dont even attempt to boot, it just straight into windows 8
2013-10-09 14:10:23	jchaike	im thinking its either a gateway thing or a windows 8 thing
2013-10-09 14:11:33	jhartigan	did you disable the security in bios
2013-10-09 14:12:33	jchaike	hmm, i didnt really look for any option like that (im trying to be discrete, a DOS blue screen im afraid draws attention haha) you think that would cause that kind of issue? where the closest ive gotten to any linux booting was the fedora teardrop loading screen and then it fails
2013-10-09 14:13:13	jhartigan	any pc with windows 8 has security settings in its bios/efi that prevent installation
2013-10-09 14:13:15	jhartigan	so yes
2013-10-09 14:13:17	jhartigan	i think thats a problem
2013-10-09 14:13:34	jchaike	oh wow i didnt realize that, cool thanks
2013-10-09 14:13:49	jhartigan	sure thing

2013-10-09 15:39:33	kweaver	wednesday or friday for me
2013-10-09 15:41:21	jhartigan	im thinking we should stop splitting tabs
2013-10-09 15:41:27	jhartigan	it seems much more beneficial if we do
2013-10-09 15:42:28	jspeak	well i like going wednesdays more than fridays
2013-10-09 15:44:27	jhartigan	sames
2013-10-09 15:46:37	kweaver	splitting meaning sharing, or splitting meaning separating?
2013-10-09 15:46:54	jhartigan	splitting meaning separating
2013-10-09 15:46:57	jhartigan	everytime we get one check
2013-10-09 15:47:03	jhartigan	its even cheaper than separate
2013-10-09 15:47:10	kweaver	ew
2013-10-09 15:47:17	kweaver	yeah its double edged
2013-10-09 15:47:22	matthewspeak	they charge you for that?
2013-10-09 15:47:22	kweaver	I think we pay less when we split
2013-10-09 15:47:31	kweaver	nah
2013-10-09 15:47:35	matthewspeak	or ryan just hooks us up?
2013-10-09 15:48:06	kweaver	eh actually i dunno
2013-10-09 15:48:40	jhartigan	i mean we payed more with the girls, but overallll its been even cheaper than split i think when weve ordered together
2013-10-09 15:49:25	kweaver	so far whenever we've split, we dont tip as nicely, because we're looking at a big total and its scary, and we dont want to speak for anyone else with their money
2013-10-09 15:49:34	kweaver	splitting is just a pain in the dick and requires cash
2013-10-09 15:49:39	kweaver	which I almost never have
2013-10-09 15:49:41	kweaver	or want to have
2013-10-09 15:50:03	jspeak	i dont get it, why is it cheaper one way or the other?
2013-10-09 15:50:21	kweaver	well so far, whenever we've split, we've gotten more free shit
2013-10-09 15:50:22	jhartigan	when the checks are split its usually 1 free drink. 2 if youre there for a while
2013-10-09 15:50:43	jspeak	ooh
2013-10-09 15:50:43	jhartigan	when its one check both times kev and i get like mutliple free beers
2013-10-09 15:50:50	jhartigan	even on a shorter trip
2013-10-09 15:52:33	jhartigan	separate checks are still free beers which is legit, but multiple free is even more legit
2013-10-09 15:53:37	kweaver	my biggest peave is cash
2013-10-09 15:54:16	jhartigan	yeah but i suppose tappin the macson on the way isnt bad
2013-10-09 15:54:20	jhartigan	simple also has money sharing now
2013-10-09 15:54:22	jhartigan	btw
2013-10-09 15:54:26	jhartigan	just noticed it last night
2013-10-09 15:58:04	jhartigan	anyways round 5 im gonna do this new workout im trying. took me like 50 min so sometime round 6ish pbs jspeak ?
2013-10-09 15:59:41	@tommyvyo	test it out and share me some money jhartigan
2013-10-09 15:59:53	jhartigan	no you try it with me
2013-10-09 16:00:35	jspeak	sure

2013-10-09 16:02:51	kweaver	jhartigan:  does send money cost anything?
2013-10-09 16:04:32	jhartigan	i didnt go that far.. im gonna assume no, given their no fee structure
2013-10-09 16:04:33	jhartigan	but who knows

2013-10-10 09:28:50	matthewspeak	is it easy to make text images using the google glass font?
2013-10-10 09:29:09	matthewspeak	just like a jpg that says my name, or whatever, in that font

2013-10-10 09:30:50	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-10 09:30:53	ericmazzola	what is it going to be used for?
2013-10-10 09:31:02	ericmazzola	and do you need anything else involved with it?
2013-10-10 09:31:05	matthewspeak	presentation for grad school
2013-10-10 09:31:23	matthewspeak	my name would be cool for the first slide.  but if it's easy, maybe slide titles

2013-10-10 09:32:25	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-10 09:32:51	ericmazzola	http://www.dafont.com/arual.font
2013-10-10 09:32:54	ericmazzola	check that
2013-10-10 09:32:57	ericmazzola	it's free
2013-10-10 09:32:58	ericmazzola	and similar
2013-10-10 09:33:19	ericmazzola	you could just install that font, and use it in your presentation as a title
2013-10-10 09:34:18	ericmazzola	in general, if you can avoid text being rasterized (turned into an image instead of the mathematical formula that governs what the letters look like), you should
2013-10-10 09:34:34	ericmazzola	does that make sense?
2013-10-10 09:34:38	matthewspeak	kinda
2013-10-10 09:34:47	matthewspeak	you're saying text is better than image with text?
2013-10-10 09:35:13	ericmazzola	you're doing it for a powerpoint presentation?
2013-10-10 09:35:25	matthewspeak	yeah
2013-10-10 09:35:46	matthewspeak	well google docs, saved as .ppt or whatever, and running on powerpoint on another computer
2013-10-10 09:35:55	ericmazzola	ohh gotcha
2013-10-10 09:36:05	ericmazzola	so you're worried about the font not working on another computer?
2013-10-10 09:36:17	kweaver1	in thas case, it's probably fine just to rasterize the text into the image
2013-10-10 09:36:17	ericmazzola	because it's not installed on it
2013-10-10 09:36:22	matthewspeak	if i go the text route, yes
2013-10-10 09:36:27	ericmazzola	okayy
2013-10-10 09:36:59	matthewspeak	what's the issue with making it an image?
2013-10-10 09:37:11	ericmazzola	in this particular case, not much
2013-10-10 09:37:24	matthewspeak	ok cool
2013-10-10 09:37:35	kweaver1	mazz is just sayings for best practices

2013-10-10 11:00:48	jhartigan	wtf tommyvyo  youre not kidding the overalpping sessions are insane
2013-10-10 11:00:58	jhartigan	im trying to plan out what i wanna see tomorrow and fucksticks
2013-10-10 11:01:07	@tommyvyo	jfortunato: yessir
2013-10-10 11:01:31	jfortunato	have you used angular?
2013-10-10 11:01:36	@tommyvyo	in regards to using backbone js, i got a ping from u somewhere ^^
2013-10-10 11:02:14	@tommyvyo	ive checked it out very briefly, im waiting a little bit to decide whether i want to use angular, ember, or ext
2013-10-10 11:02:23	jfortunato	word
2013-10-10 11:02:37	jfortunato	im just trying to decide on something
2013-10-10 11:02:48	jfortunato	so i can improve on my jquery spaghetti lol
2013-10-10 11:03:13	jhartigan	write only javascript!
2013-10-10 11:03:39	jfortunato	yea thats an option as well
2013-10-10 11:04:03	jhartigan	i tired it for a bit. problem is it doesnt help much in the areas that jquery alreay improves
2013-10-10 11:04:11	jhartigan	or at least didnt seem to.
2013-10-10 11:04:30	jfortunato	its just the code I write is heavily tied to the DOM
2013-10-10 11:04:32	jhartigan	kweaver1: http://www.drupaldelphia.com/sessions    make a list and lets see what overlaps
2013-10-10 11:04:36	jfortunato	and that needs to improve
2013-10-10 11:10:54	@tommyvyo	jfortunato: have you done anything with backbone yet?
2013-10-10 11:11:11	jfortunato	no just looking at my options
2013-10-10 11:11:20	jfortunato	looking at TodoMVC
2013-10-10 11:11:23	@tommyvyo	word, ember and angular would be good options for large scale web applications
2013-10-10 11:11:30	@tommyvyo	backbone is good for smaller things
2013-10-10 11:12:07	@tommyvyo	also, addy osmani is da man
2013-10-10 11:12:25	jfortunato	thats the todomvc guy right

2013-10-10 14:35:36	@tommyvyo	sitting there like listening to every word, but in my head im behind by 3 words cause im slowly translating and taking best guess shots at what she is saying..
2013-10-10 14:37:15	MpWilli__	hah was she foreign ?

2013-10-10 14:55:10	kweaver	did I tell you 
2013-10-10 14:55:22	kweaver	even if your bitsync folder is on a different partition
2013-10-10 14:55:30	kweaver	it still syncs
2013-10-10 14:55:57	kweaver	remember we were thinking about the best way to set up bitsync on my tiny laptop SSD
2013-10-10 14:56:26	kweaver	and we decided just to put it on the windows HDD, and just let it sync whenever im in windows
2013-10-10 14:57:34	kweaver	makes sense though, as long as the HDD is mounted within linux's control, nothing else should matter

2013-10-10 16:22:12	jhartigan	also the server seems stable at 400mb free kweaver looks like it just uses what it can with cache we just had bad swappiness before
2013-10-10 16:28:23	kweaver1	jhartigan: have you been getting bitsync notifications from everything I do?
2013-10-10 16:28:56	kweaver1	Im downloading all of our ugurus web design sales kit now

2013-10-16 21:55:46	@MpWilli	yeah i did and then i added my own on top of the ones already there
2013-10-16 21:55:52	@MpWilli	im trying to remember which one i used
2013-10-16 21:56:51	kweaver	aye
2013-10-16 21:58:12	kweaver	im in the process of designing a general static coming soon page that I can quickly slap on when we start sites
2013-10-16 21:59:06	@MpWilli	oh word
2013-10-16 21:59:18	@MpWilli	kweaver do you want me to just send you my animation files?

2013-10-16 21:59:46	kweaver	kevin@omni-dev.com
2013-10-16 22:00:16	kweaver	there are plenty of static Coming Soon pages that I could use
2013-10-16 22:00:26	kweaver	the problem is that they are either barebones and ugly
2013-10-16 22:00:41	@MpWilli	word i hear ya
2013-10-16 22:00:49	kweaver	or come with an entire structure of their own with js/css/images
2013-10-16 22:00:53	kweaver	that I dont want to deal with
2013-10-16 22:00:56	@MpWilli	yeah thats a pain
2013-10-16 22:01:08	kweaver	so my plan is one file
2013-10-16 22:01:11	kweaver	index.html
2013-10-16 22:01:16	kweaver	that will hold everything
2013-10-16 22:01:17	kweaver	no images
2013-10-16 22:01:27	kweaver	just web fonts
2013-10-16 22:01:35	kweaver	font-awesome for the icons
2013-10-16 22:01:40	kweaver	I want no configuration
2013-10-16 22:02:08	kweaver	just pasting one file, and maybe change an <h1> for the company
2013-10-16 22:02:30	@MpWilli	okay you cool with using scss or nah?
2013-10-16 22:02:37	kweaver	send it over anyway
2013-10-16 22:02:38	@MpWilli	cuz thats what my animations are written in
2013-10-16 22:02:39	@MpWilli	ok
2013-10-16 22:02:59	kweaver	might not use it for this, but it might left me cut a corner later in life

2013-10-16 22:08:48	kweaver	since Im not using any images, I wanted to see what sort of pure css3 objects I could use
2013-10-16 22:08:55	kweaver	I was thinking about using this: http://tjrus.com/iphone/
2013-10-16 22:09:19	@MpWilli	depends on if you care about browser support
2013-10-16 22:09:31	kweaver	well I planned on only caring about 9 and 8
2013-10-16 22:09:37	kweaver	10, 9, and 8
2013-10-16 22:09:44	@MpWilli	i doubt that iphone would look nice in 8
2013-10-16 22:09:46	kweaver	fuggin 8 cant even to gradients
2013-10-16 22:09:53	@MpWilli	or radius
2013-10-16 22:10:01	kweaver	nah it does that
2013-10-16 22:10:03	@MpWilli	or animation
2013-10-16 22:10:07	@MpWilli	brb

2013-10-16 22:10:40	kweaver	fuggin 9 cant even do gradients I mean
2013-10-16 22:11:10	kweaver	I meant to say that I didnt care about 8, and I would just hide it in that
2013-10-16 22:13:07	@MpWilli	why arent ya using images
2013-10-16 22:13:23	@MpWilli	like theyre perfectly acceptable in modern sites

2013-10-16 22:16:17	kweaver	it wasnt set up properly, so flattening an image changed the transparent shadow color
2013-10-16 22:16:27	kweaver	so i was going back and forth with them about it
2013-10-16 22:16:36	kweaver	and he didnt respond for like a week
2013-10-16 22:16:43	kweaver	and I was like "sooooo... whats up"

2013-10-16 22:17:30	kweaver	and he was like "hey man, im sorry, I cant really get to fixing that anytime soon.  in return im going to refund your initial membership costs, and give you a free 6 months"
2013-10-16 22:17:36	kweaver	and i was like "lololo kthx"
2013-10-16 22:18:00	kweaver	and then he was like "actually, since you didnt pay with paypal, the refund aspect might be an issue"
2013-10-16 22:18:09	kweaver	and i was like "thats fine, im cool with 6 months free"
2013-10-16 22:18:35	kweaver	and then he was like "actually, I just went ahead and gave you a free lifetime premium membership forever"
2013-10-16 22:18:50	kweaver	boom customer service

2013-10-17 16:07:22	ericmazzola	so you go into it with the expectation that it's like the best beer ever
2013-10-17 16:07:27	jhartigan	its a great blend of fruit and hops
2013-10-17 16:07:30	kweaver_laptop	"you are just taught that it is good" lololol wtf does that mean

2013-10-17 16:12:40	jspeak	oooooh ddba
2013-10-17 16:12:46	jhartigan	although nugget and dales kinda overlap
2013-10-17 16:12:48	ericmazzola	ddba?
2013-10-17 16:12:48	jspeak	that would have to be one my top 5 i think
2013-10-17 16:12:53	ericmazzola	nugget is imperial amber
2013-10-17 16:12:54	jhartigan	double double barrel aged
2013-10-17 16:12:56	jspeak	double double barrel aged
2013-10-17 16:12:59	jspeak	johny walker
2013-10-17 16:13:11	jhartigan	the two bombers i brought for your party
2013-10-17 16:13:16	jhartigan	from firestone
2013-10-17 16:13:20	ericmazzola	nugget is far and beyond the best amber
2013-10-17 16:13:28	ericmazzola	ahh gotcha
2013-10-17 16:13:32	jhartigan	okay if its amber my list works out
2013-10-17 16:13:53	jhartigan	amber stout ipa pa scotchale
2013-10-17 16:14:14	kweaver_laptop	what is redfish technically?  amber?
2013-10-17 16:14:21	jspeak	red ale
2013-10-17 16:14:29	jhartigan	^
2013-10-17 16:14:39	kweaver_laptop	I havent tried many other red ales
2013-10-17 16:14:44	ericmazzola	I want to find a good red
2013-10-17 16:14:44	ericmazzola	noone makes them though
2013-10-17 16:14:48	kweaver_laptop	so if thats a category i guess ill put it there
2013-10-17 16:14:53	jhartigan	red fish is a very different red
2013-10-17 16:14:55	ericmazzola	I've heard one of the best is Burning Rivers
2013-10-17 16:14:59	ericmazzola	red fish is good
2013-10-17 16:15:00	jhartigan	doesnt really fit standard irish reds
2013-10-17 16:15:06	jhartigan	and i dont think its a belgian red
2013-10-17 16:16:43	kweaver_laptop	I think ill put Brew free or die ipa on my list of captains
2013-10-17 16:16:49	kweaver_laptop	that's the list below elites
2013-10-17 16:16:55	kweaver_laptop	but still high ranking
2013-10-17 16:17:07	jhartigan	eh its good. but i like alotta others more
2013-10-17 16:17:10	jhartigan	on the ipa route
2013-10-17 16:17:16	kweaver_laptop	its def more on the fruity side
2013-10-17 16:17:24	kweaver_laptop	a good dinner ipa
2013-10-17 16:17:34	jhartigan	2x is still my standard staple if i had to forever kinda deal
2013-10-17 16:17:44	jhartigan	fruity and hoppy
2013-10-17 16:17:48	jhartigan	enough to get you drunk
2013-10-17 16:17:54	jhartigan	but not like 9%
2013-10-17 16:18:57	kweaver_laptop	moving the discussion on to wines
2013-10-17 16:19:03	kweaver_laptop	best merlot
2013-10-17 16:19:04	kweaver_laptop	go
2013-10-17 16:19:20	kweaver_laptop	jk i still need to work on mah wines
2013-10-17 16:19:32	jhartigan	i know red / white
2013-10-17 16:19:53	kweaver_laptop	Ive been to 7 different wineries for tastings though
2013-10-17 16:20:01	kweaver_laptop	8?
2013-10-17 16:20:16	kweaver_laptop	so Im at least beginning to see the flavor of each style
2013-10-17 16:20:28	kweaver_laptop	I dont have any favorites though
2013-10-17 16:20:31	jhartigan	sweet shit / sweet red shit
2013-10-17 16:20:34	jhartigan	duh
2013-10-17 16:21:02	jhartigan	blizzard heroes of the storm announced
2013-10-17 16:27:33	kweaver_laptop	the moba market is already so fragmented, and yet they all seem to have good reasons to exist
2013-10-17 16:27:53	kweaver_laptop	of course valve's needs to exist, since they own the dota ip
2013-10-17 16:28:09	kweaver_laptop	of course blizzards needs to exist, since dota was originally warcraft mod
2013-10-17 16:28:14	jhartigan	they all dont have good reasons
2013-10-17 16:28:16	jhartigan	league and dota do
2013-10-17 16:28:30	kweaver_laptop	you dont think blizzard will pull it off?
2013-10-17 16:28:36	kweaver_laptop	I think the idea is pretty cool
2013-10-17 16:28:40	jhartigan	hon should just roll over.. its in a bed of nails covered in lit gasoline
2013-10-17 16:28:43	jhartigan	blizzards too late
2013-10-17 16:28:44	kweaver_laptop	thrall vs raynor
2013-10-17 16:28:54	jhartigan	and offering a game easier than league if they didnt change the plan
2013-10-17 16:29:00	jhartigan	and itll probably run like ass
2013-10-17 16:29:04	jhartigan	given how they program sc2
2013-10-17 16:29:10	jhartigan	it doesnt have a place
2013-10-17 16:29:19	jhartigan	s2s new moba doesnt have a place
2013-10-17 16:29:32	kweaver_laptop	i dont know anything about it, other than my trust in blizzard as a company
2013-10-17 16:29:43	ericmazzola	you still trust them?
2013-10-17 16:29:44	ericmazzola	lmao
2013-10-17 16:29:51	kweaver_laptop	D3 sucked
2013-10-17 16:29:51	ericmazzola	i want to
2013-10-17 16:29:53	jhartigan	dunno what blizzard youre referring to, but i think you should know they died about 5 years ag
2013-10-17 16:29:54	kweaver_laptop	1 bad game
2013-10-17 16:30:00	ericmazzola	i liked d3
2013-10-17 16:30:03	kweaver_laptop	out of everything else
2013-10-17 16:30:09	jhartigan	blizzard died when activision bought them
2013-10-17 16:30:19	ericmazzola	yes
2013-10-17 16:30:21	kweaver_laptop	yeah they definitely turned to the dark side
2013-10-17 16:30:22	ericmazzola	exactly
2013-10-17 16:30:23	jhartigan	sc2 has constantly suffered from poor programming and poor management
2013-10-17 16:30:30	kweaver_laptop	but theyre capable of putting out good games
2013-10-17 16:30:36	jhartigan	maybe
2013-10-17 16:30:56	jhartigan	blizzard time doesnt work in a saturated market.  league and dota have too many players
2013-10-17 16:31:02	jhartigan	though maybe they can get hon players
2013-10-17 16:31:09	ericmazzola	well they killed the d3 auction house
2013-10-17 16:31:13	jhartigan	or othe marvel players
2013-10-17 16:31:18	jhartigan	whatever that marvel moba is
2013-10-17 16:31:18	ericmazzola	so now you have to grind for your stuff again
2013-10-17 16:31:41	jhartigan	theres a goddamn bow worth 32K
2013-10-17 16:31:51	jhartigan	i might play just to get one and sell before the house dies
2013-10-17 16:31:52	ericmazzola	?
2013-10-17 16:31:53	kweaver_laptop	and they put out a pretty sweet FTP android/pc game
2013-10-17 16:32:00	kweaver_laptop	so their last 2 moves have been in the right direction
2013-10-17 16:32:04	ericmazzola	like $32,000
2013-10-17 16:32:09	jhartigan	yes ericmazzola
2013-10-17 16:32:17	ericmazzola	...
2013-10-17 16:32:25	jhartigan	yeah but hearthstones already getting criticized in beta
2013-10-17 16:32:28	jhartigan	i havent played it
2013-10-17 16:32:31	jhartigan	looks pretty decent
2013-10-17 16:32:34	jhartigan	its pay to win though
2013-10-17 16:32:36	ericmazzola	im going to try hearthstone
2013-10-17 16:32:38	ericmazzola	but yeah
2013-10-17 16:32:42	ericmazzola	what jhartigan just said
2013-10-17 16:32:43	jhartigan	apparently it gets stale
2013-10-17 16:32:46	ericmazzola	p2w
2013-10-17 16:32:52	jhartigan	stale + paytowin are not good things
2013-10-17 16:32:58	kweaver_laptop	ive never heard of an uncriticized beta, so im not worried
2013-10-17 16:33:11	ericmazzola	pay to win is NEVER a good thing
2013-10-17 16:33:15	jhartigan	its what the criticisms are thats more important
2013-10-17 16:33:20	jhartigan	pay2win is a huge problem
2013-10-17 16:33:24	kweaver_laptop	yeah true
2013-10-17 16:33:28	jhartigan	granted card games inherently have that
2013-10-17 16:33:40	kweaver_laptop	im looking at it from the perspective of a small scale android tablet game
2013-10-17 16:33:42	kweaver_laptop	of which
2013-10-17 16:33:45	kweaver_laptop	there arent many good ones
2013-10-17 16:33:47	ericmazzola	there could be an unlock system
2013-10-17 16:33:55	jhartigan	did they even say android
2013-10-17 16:33:57	kweaver_laptop	im not even considering it to be on par as a full fledged game
2013-10-17 16:34:06	kweaver_laptop	ipad first
2013-10-17 16:34:09	kweaver_laptop	android tabs later
2013-10-17 16:34:14	kweaver_laptop	I believe

2013-10-17 16:34:39	jhartigan	already making a bad decision there
2013-10-17 16:34:53	jhartigan	no mention of android on official platforms
2013-10-17 16:34:58	jhartigan	win mac ipad
2013-10-17 16:35:43	kweaver_laptop	maybe just rumors then
2013-10-17 16:35:49	kweaver_laptop	well it should go to android
2013-10-17 16:35:58	-->	MpWilli__ (~mpwilli@static-71-245-123-65.cmdnnj.fios.verizon.net) has joined #orderdeck
2013-10-17 16:36:44	jhartigan	"were thinking about android after we push it to our platforms"
2013-10-17 16:36:47	jhartigan	lol
2013-10-17 16:37:17	ericmazzola	you guys going to get the d3 expansion?
2013-10-17 16:37:20	jhartigan	blizzard needs to embrace linux if it wants to survive the next 5 years
2013-10-17 16:37:24	jhartigan	doubtful ericmazzola

2013-10-17 16:39:29	jhartigan	i had to try so much harder with POE than d3
2013-10-17 16:39:43	jhartigan	d3 got marginally difficult like in 3 spots
2013-10-17 16:39:50	jhartigan	normal POE is pretty epic
2013-10-17 16:39:54	jhartigan	if youre not looking for a story
2013-10-17 16:39:56	jhartigan	if you mean story
2013-10-17 16:39:58	jhartigan	than ya
2013-10-17 16:40:04	jhartigan	POE story is fucking silly
2013-10-17 16:40:44	ericmazzola	kweaver_laptop: do you have BF4?
2013-10-17 16:42:21	kweaver_laptop	yeah

2013-10-17 16:42:30	kweaver_laptop	yeah dude
2013-10-17 16:42:34	kweaver_laptop	its just one level so far
2013-10-17 16:42:36	ericmazzola	i would like to play that
2013-10-17 16:42:42	kweaver_laptop	a lot more of a stable beta than the bf3  beta
2013-10-17 16:43:01	kweaver_laptop	eric adam and I are all getting it when it comes out
2013-10-17 16:43:01	ericmazzola	nice
2013-10-17 16:43:06	kweaver_laptop	and if you preorder you get beta
2013-10-17 16:43:06	ericmazzola	i might too
2013-10-17 16:43:07	kweaver_laptop	errrr
2013-10-17 16:43:09	ericmazzola	i liked BF a lot
2013-10-17 16:43:10	kweaver_laptop	its open beta now
2013-10-17 16:43:14	kweaver_laptop	so you should dl the beta
2013-10-17 16:43:19	ericmazzola	i just had noone to play it with
2013-10-17 16:43:24	ericmazzola	i'll get it for sure
2013-10-17 16:43:29	kweaver_laptop	problem is that I cant promise that Ill be on much during the week
2013-10-17 16:43:30	ericmazzola	it comes out in november right?
2013-10-17 16:43:36	ericmazzola	launches with the new systems?
2013-10-17 16:43:39	kweaver_laptop	ill play a few games on the weekends though
2013-10-17 16:43:44	kweaver_laptop	yeahhh i think
2013-10-17 16:44:23	kweaver_laptop	thats series remains to be the best fps in my opinion
2013-10-17 16:44:27	kweaver_laptop	multiplayer at least
2013-10-17 16:44:32	kweaver_laptop	not so much for the single
2013-10-17 16:45:03	kweaver_laptop	theres just nothing even remotely in the same ballpark
2013-10-17 16:46:10	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-17 16:46:15	ericmazzola	The Division
2013-10-17 16:46:19	ericmazzola	THAT
2013-10-17 16:46:23	ericmazzola	is the game that im waiting for
2013-10-17 16:46:31	ericmazzola	whatever happened with Day Z?
2013-10-17 16:46:37	ericmazzola	i have seen a million clones come out
2013-10-17 16:46:50	ericmazzola	all of which are rated like 20/100
2013-10-17 16:46:50	ericmazzola	max
2013-10-17 16:47:05	ericmazzola	and the original still has no news about it
2013-10-17 16:47:31	kweaver_laptop	yeah, I think rocket's problem is an issue of scaling
2013-10-17 16:47:37	kweaver_laptop	that dude needs a full team
2013-10-17 16:47:43	kweaver_laptop	and some project management
2013-10-17 16:47:47	kweaver_laptop	he has a few developers with him
2013-10-17 16:47:56	kweaver_laptop	but it still sounds so under funded
2013-10-17 16:48:27	kweaver_laptop	its having such slowwwww progression
2013-10-17 16:48:44	kweaver_laptop	just seems like rocket wants to oversee every single aspect
2013-10-17 16:52:44	kweaver_laptop	I sat through his panel last pax where he showed off the current version.  it looks sooooooo far behind anything remotely stable
2013-10-17 16:52:48	kweaver_laptop	looked**
2013-10-17 16:52:56	kweaver_laptop	that was half a year ago though
2013-10-17 16:53:19	kweaver_laptop	ericmazzola: download the bf4 open beta and see if you like it
2013-10-17 16:53:24	kweaver_laptop	id play a round or two if you do
2013-10-17 16:53:44	kweaver_laptop	im gonna go eat
2013-10-17 16:53:46	kweaver_laptop	laterrr
2013-10-17 16:54:02	jhartigan	yeah gonna feed the dog and take er out

2013-10-18 12:36:59	beadyox	hate when i can't remember passwords...
2013-10-18 12:37:38	kweaver	set up a system and dont stray.  then if you still forget, password reset that bitch
2013-10-18 12:38:09	beadyox	usually i do
2013-10-18 12:38:09	kweaver	the times when I forget a password are the sites that require rediculous shit
2013-10-18 12:38:17	beadyox	thats why i don't understand why i can't remember
2013-10-18 12:38:37	kweaver	Im well overdue for a new password system

2013-10-18 12:43:19	beadyox	yeah
2013-10-18 12:43:26	beadyox	i love those sites with the reqs
2013-10-18 12:45:29	beadyox	"Your password must be at least 8 characters long with at leaf one letter, number, and other character. You may not use two letters in a row, two numbers in a row, or two other characters in a row. Also, you must have at least one upper case letter and one lower case letter. An example of an acceptable password is "Af5%67((p-" Please remember that it is never safe to write down your password. Thank you."
2013-10-18 12:55:43	matthewspeak	Your password must contain at least 11 characters from 4 different languages and cannot include languages used in the same continent.  Your password must be changed once every 20 minutes for security purposes.
2013-10-18 12:58:45	kweaver	lololol
2013-10-18 12:58:46	kweaver	yeah
2013-10-18 12:59:04	kweaver	our credit card processor account password has to change every month I think
2013-10-18 13:02:11	beadyox	thats ridiculous
2013-10-18 13:02:37	beadyox	i wonder if they just do that to make you FEEL safer rather than there actually being a practical security advantage
2013-10-18 13:21:01	kweaver	I imagine it's only moderately safer
2013-10-18 13:21:28	kweaver	the problem with that model is that they are assuming everyone is going to create entirely different passwords each month
2013-10-18 13:21:48	kweaver	when in reality, they're just going to keep incrementing a digit by 1
2013-10-18 13:22:47	kweaver	so if a hacker somehow found out a users password for something else, they just need to try that password1, password2, password3 etc
2013-10-18 13:25:16	beadyox	i dunno
2013-10-18 13:25:17	beadyox	i mean
2013-10-18 13:25:24	beadyox	i don't know anything about this stuff
2013-10-18 13:25:59	beadyox	but i would have to imagine that 99% of the risk is due to insecure traffic in and out of their servers or the users servers rather than crappy passwords
2013-10-18 13:26:32	kweaver	its both
2013-10-18 13:26:50	kweaver	hackers dont have to guess passwords anymore
2013-10-18 13:27:13	kweaver	theyll just write a bot that brute forces 100 passwords a second
2013-10-18 13:27:43	kweaver	thats why a lot of sites only allow like 4 mistakes
2013-10-18 13:27:51	kweaver	which is annoying, but a great security measure
2013-10-18 13:29:05	kweaver	at the same time, notifying the user that they have a valid email, but and invalid password is also bad for security.
2013-10-18 13:32:36	beadyox	i find that most of them say your username and/or password is invalid
2013-10-18 13:32:40	beadyox	they don't specify which

2013-10-18 13:52:22	beadyox	i just remembered next year congress elections are coming around again!
2013-10-18 13:54:37	beadyox	i might run
2013-10-18 13:58:20	kweaver	do it up beadyox !
2013-10-18 13:58:43	kweaver	NJ or US?
2013-10-18 13:59:03	beadyox	US!!
2013-10-18 13:59:12	kweaver	lol are you really gonna run?

2013-10-18 14:00:41	beadyox	cause i don't have money to fund myself and no one wants to dump money into a campaign running against a 20 some odd year incumbent
2013-10-18 14:02:28	kweaver	yeah dude, do what you makes you happy.  I dont mean to shit on your dreams, but yeah I dont think we will ever see 23 year old congressmen elected with no political or high level business background in our lifetime.
2013-10-18 14:02:52	kweaver	I think you gotta start lower
2013-10-18 14:03:20	kweaver	even NJ would be a pretty massive stretch.  youd really have to start at a city level
2013-10-18 14:04:16	kweaver	state level politians are generally town mayors and high profile people
2013-10-18 14:04:55	kweaver	us politians have generally been state politicians and/or state governors for a very long time

2013-10-18 14:05:24	beadyox	obama was a first term senator who won the presidency
2013-10-18 14:05:31	beadyox	hahahah
2013-10-18 14:05:41	kweaver	he's also black
2013-10-18 14:05:47	kweaver	so people were rooting for him

2013-10-18 14:05:51	kweaver	haha
2013-10-18 14:05:53	beadyox	maybe i should tell people I'm gay
2013-10-18 14:06:00	kweaver	you should dude
2013-10-18 14:06:08	kweaver	that would be a pretty huge political boost

2013-10-18 14:07:04	kweaver	RIGHT HERE
2013-10-18 14:07:06	kweaver	RIGHT NOW
2013-10-18 14:07:40	beadyox	i was thinking of running for state rep or something but everyone in our area who is in office is a democrat
2013-10-18 14:07:45	beadyox	id have to run as a republican hahaha
2013-10-18 14:07:52	kweaver	lololol
2013-10-18 14:08:00	kweaver	well you could be the ron paul of our state
2013-10-18 14:08:05	beadyox	which i guess i more or less am what a true republican is supposed to be
2013-10-18 14:08:06	beadyox	sort of
2013-10-18 14:14:11	matthewspeak	libertarian beadyox?
2013-10-18 14:16:49	beadyox	more or less but not quite as extreme
2013-10-18 14:17:01	beadyox	i feel like some libertarians border on anarchists
2013-10-18 14:17:20	matthewspeak	yeah same
2013-10-18 14:17:55	matthewspeak	that's what happens when they try to stand out from dems/reps, they go too far to differentiate
2013-10-18 14:19:07	beadyox	nah see
2013-10-18 14:19:26	beadyox	i just want people to do whatever the hell they want in the privacy of their own homes as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else
2013-10-18 14:19:38	matthewspeak	same
2013-10-18 14:19:44	beadyox	but i think the government needs to be involved to an extent in some programs like things that should be public goods
2013-10-18 14:19:50	beadyox	such as military
2013-10-18 14:20:05	matthewspeak	yeah
2013-10-18 14:20:09	beadyox	but i would expand it to healthcare and even the internet as these things are becoming basic human rights
2013-10-18 14:20:16	beadyox	well healthcare has always been a basic human right
2013-10-18 14:21:02	matthewspeak	i absolutely 110% do not trust the government to control the internet
2013-10-18 14:21:12	matthewspeak	haha
2013-10-18 14:21:20	beadyox	what if the government said
2013-10-18 14:21:35	matthewspeak	healthcare? ehh i'm in the middle
2013-10-18 14:21:46	jhartigan	i would never trust the government in control of the internet
2013-10-18 14:21:50	beadyox	look, we're gonna make your internet 100x faster than those assholes at comcast, and we're going to fund it by taxing the churches that are tax exempt for no reason
2013-10-18 14:21:52	jhartigan	they shouldnt have any part in it
2013-10-18 14:22:06	beadyox	I'm not talking about spying on the internet ;)
2013-10-18 14:22:32	jhartigan	its inherently implied.  if they wanna tax people and give out internet thats fine, but id say healthcare should come first
2013-10-18 14:22:36	matthewspeak	they'll inherit control though
2013-10-18 14:22:44	jhartigan	^
2013-10-18 14:22:49	kweaver	leave the internet to the free market
2013-10-18 14:23:04	matthewspeak	agreed
2013-10-18 14:23:06	kweaver	google fiber is going to replace comcast and verizon soon because they inovated
2013-10-18 14:23:07	beadyox	yes because my choice between comcast and comcast has gotten me real far
2013-10-18 14:23:22	matthewspeak	it's improving
2013-10-18 14:23:31	jhartigan	the only reason the government would get involved in the internet is for their personal gains
2013-10-18 14:23:38	matthewspeak	google X will put internet across the world soon enough
2013-10-18 14:23:44	jhartigan	well thats because we dont use our antitrust laws beadyox
2013-10-18 14:24:00	jhartigan	the fact that viacom isnt considered a monopoly makes no sense to me
2013-10-18 14:24:15	matthewspeak	well not so much personal gains, but desire to control
2013-10-18 14:24:25	beadyox	i don't even know why
2013-10-18 14:24:31	beadyox	the government is freaking weird
2013-10-18 14:24:32	jhartigan	goverment regulations are already in place to prevent the comcast situation, they just arent in use
2013-10-18 14:24:33	beadyox	when you think about it
2013-10-18 14:24:34	matthewspeak	i guess monopoly would imply that all competition is absorbed?  i'm not sure
2013-10-18 14:25:09	beadyox	if i had absolute control over stuff
2013-10-18 14:25:12	jhartigan	i dont know the specifics of the antitrust laws but thats not supposed to be the cae
2013-10-18 14:25:19	jhartigan	if that were, its a shitty law
2013-10-18 14:25:22	kweaver	but even oligopolies have been broken apart in the past
2013-10-18 14:25:33	beadyox	id do so much of this stuff that you guys hate because you think the govt would interfere
2013-10-18 14:25:43	beadyox	and then before i left id put stuff in place to make sure they never could
2013-10-18 14:25:55	jhartigan	but you cant make sure of that
2013-10-18 14:26:03	jhartigan	you can try
2013-10-18 14:26:08	jhartigan	and be comepletey vigilant in i
2013-10-18 14:26:10	jhartigan	it*
2013-10-18 14:26:19	beadyox	well the thing is, the natural tendency of humans is to be in control
2013-10-18 14:26:29	beadyox	its ultimately up to the masses to keep it in check
2013-10-18 14:26:42	beadyox	problem is the masses don't do shit until it reaches a boiling point
2013-10-18 14:26:46	beadyox	then they overreact
2013-10-18 14:26:52	jhartigan	but look at where w are now. spying revealed in rampantly escalating levels.  I wouldnt be at all surprised if theres a killswitch a la syria and egypt if say martial law was declared
2013-10-18 14:27:06	beadyox	oh dude of course there is
2013-10-18 14:27:35	beadyox	they act like the world wouldn't know haha
2013-10-18 14:27:47	beadyox	"the internet in syria went out"
2013-10-18 14:27:53	beadyox	"thats funny, must be a malfunction"
2013-10-18 14:28:40	jhartigan	nah for sure
2013-10-18 14:28:43	beadyox	actually though
2013-10-18 14:29:04	jhartigan	but then you have the same situation. syrian governemt says whats up, everyone else has to find a way to tell them otherwise
2013-10-18 14:29:06	jhartigan	ideally
2013-10-18 14:29:10	jhartigan	a meshnet becomes the internet
2013-10-18 14:29:15	jhartigan	no need for subscriptions
2013-10-18 14:29:17	beadyox	pretty much all i would want to accomplish is gay rights and legalize and regulate drugs and prostitution
2013-10-18 14:29:23	jhartigan	most of the world is already setup for it
2013-10-18 14:30:27	beadyox	i care more about what people should be free to do than what the government should provide
2013-10-18 14:30:33	beadyox	what is a meshnet
2013-10-18 14:30:33	jhartigan	yeah
2013-10-18 14:30:46	jhartigan	meshnet is network to network communication
2013-10-18 14:30:52	jhartigan	say my wifi network and yours overlap
2013-10-18 14:30:54	jhartigan	boom host website
2013-10-18 14:30:57	jhartigan	irc channels
2013-10-18 14:30:59	jhartigan	etc
2013-10-18 14:31:03	jhartigan	theres a huge one if greece
2013-10-18 14:31:11	jhartigan	largest one in the world right now
2013-10-18 14:31:21	beadyox	how would that work to bypass an internet killswitch
2013-10-18 14:31:25	jhartigan	you just piggy back on networks
2013-10-18 14:31:32	jhartigan	you dont atually use the internet
2013-10-18 14:31:45	jhartigan	not so much sharing internet
2013-10-18 14:31:49	jhartigan	sharing connections
2013-10-18 14:32:00	jhartigan	within them you have someone thats running an online store
2013-10-18 14:32:05	jhartigan	someone running an irc server
2013-10-18 14:32:11	jhartigan	somone else has an image host
2013-10-18 14:32:13	jhartigan	etc
2013-10-18 14:32:17	jhartigan	its a cool idea
2013-10-18 14:32:28	jhartigan	feasible now, probable maybe in 10 years
2013-10-18 14:34:27	beadyox	you know what i would like to see
2013-10-18 14:34:32	beadyox	just out of curiosity
2013-10-18 14:34:52	beadyox	the actual numbers of attacks that have been thwarted because of prism
2013-10-18 14:35:04	beadyox	impossible to ever know but it would be interesting
2013-10-18 14:35:06	jhartigan	lol id love to see it as well
2013-10-18 14:35:13	beadyox	i can't imagine it would be more than a handful really
2013-10-18 14:35:57	matthewspeak	swanson/knope 2016
2013-10-18 14:36:38	beadyox	these idiots put resources in the wrong places thats for sure
2013-10-18 14:39:06	jhartigan	id vote for swanson so hard
2013-10-18 14:39:16	beadyox	should be putting money into the electric grid and infrastructure rather than prism
2013-10-18 14:39:24	beadyox	ron swanson
2013-10-18 14:39:55	jhartigan	is tommyvyo still out on a nature hike
2013-10-18 14:39:59	jhartigan	i have nginx questions
2013-10-18 14:40:02	jhartigan	ps and qs
2013-10-18 14:40:33	beadyox	and yeah government provided internet sounds like a terrible idea forget i ever said that
2013-10-18 14:42:09	beadyox	by the way you know what
2013-10-18 14:42:22	beadyox	some guy on reddit who commented on one of my comments got me thinking
2013-10-18 14:42:57	kweaver	damn jhartigan, still have to figure out why my monit notifications arent going off in the right order
2013-10-18 14:43:19	jhartigan	haha kweaver i just about shit myself when i restarted nginx
2013-10-18 14:43:25	jhartigan	phones charging next to me
2013-10-18 14:43:27	beadyox	he said something along the lines of how he used to like to think that obama was a good guy and the media and people were just giving him a hard time, but he can't think that someone who orders drone strikes that kill innocent people is a decent human being
2013-10-18 14:43:59	kweaver	hah
2013-10-18 14:44:03	kweaver	thats a good fear jhartigan
2013-10-18 14:44:18	jhartigan	tommyvyo: !
2013-10-18 14:44:22	jhartigan	i have questions damnit
2013-10-18 14:44:42	@tommyvyo	What's up
2013-10-18 14:45:09	jhartigan	haha
2013-10-18 14:45:59	jhartigan	with nginx proxy pass. i set the location to / because i want it to resolve when the port 80 request is for jira.omni-dev.com
2013-10-18 14:46:08	jhartigan	i gave it another subdomain and it also goes there
2013-10-18 14:46:18	jhartigan	is that something to do with my location setting in the server block?
2013-10-18 14:47:02	kweaver	beadyox I find the issue of drone strikes to be a more complex one than meets the eye.  when you word things like "How could any decent human being drop a bomb on innocent people?", you are absolutely simplifying the issue at hand
2013-10-18 14:47:33	kweaver	the only difference between dropping a bomb with a drone, and dropping a bomb with a plane is that one has a person inside
2013-10-18 14:47:41	kweaver	we're doing the same thing we always have
2013-10-18 14:47:52	@tommyvyo	Lol
2013-10-18 14:47:54	kweaver	just through a safter means
2013-10-18 14:48:05	beadyox	well thats just the thing
2013-10-18 14:48:16	kweaver	the issue at hand isnt the drone
2013-10-18 14:48:20	@tommyvyo	What's ur confit look like Jhartigan
2013-10-18 14:48:21	kweaver	its the idea of dropping any bomb
2013-10-18 14:48:26	@tommyvyo	Configggg
2013-10-18 14:48:33	beadyox	bombing actually isn't as effective a means at bringing a country to its knees as we've been led to believe
2013-10-18 14:48:44	beadyox	thats what i mean
2013-10-18 14:48:57	beadyox	so i didn't take that as just a thing against obama
2013-10-18 14:49:09	beadyox	it got me to thinking about any president in the recent past
2013-10-18 14:49:20	beadyox	any world leader
2013-10-18 14:49:25	jhartigan	ill gist it up tommyvyo
2013-10-18 14:52:48	beadyox	like kweaver
2013-10-18 14:52:56	kweaver	even that is a pretty general statement. I think drones can be a very powerful tool, and strikes should be analyzed on a case by case basis
2013-10-18 14:52:59	jhartigan	tommyvyo:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/418617feb9e3bde1169e
2013-10-18 14:53:27	matthewspeak	they used drones to deliver beer at a music festival in south africa
2013-10-18 14:53:34	matthewspeak	this past summer
2013-10-18 14:53:37	kweaver	hahaha exactly
2013-10-18 14:53:45	kweaver	that kind of drone strike
2013-10-18 14:53:48	kweaver	over a mass of people
2013-10-18 14:53:50	beadyox	well the thing is, if you look at every case of bombings since they were invented and used in war, theres only been 1 case of a major power using it to any measurable effect
2013-10-18 14:53:50	matthewspeak	commerce mobile app
2013-10-18 14:53:57	matthewspeak	beer divered to phone gps coordinates
2013-10-18 14:53:58	kweaver	is technology at its finest
2013-10-18 14:53:58	matthewspeak	bam
2013-10-18 14:54:25	jhartigan	someone made it matthewspeak
2013-10-18 14:54:26	jhartigan	similar anyway
2013-10-18 14:54:30	matthewspeak	wham bam beer in your hand thank you ma'am
2013-10-18 14:54:43	matthewspeak	?
2013-10-18 14:54:45	kweaver	id have to read the article youre referring yo beadyox
2013-10-18 14:54:50	kweaver	to**
2013-10-18 14:55:37	beadyox	http://www.amazon.com/The-Tragedy-Great-Power-Politics/dp/039332396X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382122525&sr=8-1&keywords=the+tragedy+of+great+power+politics

2013-10-18 14:55:38	kweaver	its a pretty broad statement to say "A bomb has only even been useful one time in history"
2013-10-18 14:55:42	kweaver	"i think it was a tuesday"
2013-10-18 14:55:53	beadyox	i'd like to see a clear study of what has been done during the recent conflicts though
2013-10-18 14:56:47	kweaver	yeahm it goes without saying that both of our arguments would benefit from some raw figures
2013-10-18 14:56:51	kweaver	figures we dont have access to
2013-10-18 14:56:54	beadyox	i dunno this is how i form opinions kweaver: i see an opposing view point, i accept it as true for awhile, argue for it, get arguments against it, alter my views accordingly ;)
2013-10-18 14:58:05	kweaver	matthewspeak: https://vimeo.com/73417594
2013-10-18 14:58:34	beadyox	one of the things that book argues though is that the only determining factor in a conflict is manpower
2013-10-18 14:59:27	matthewspeak	nice kweaver
2013-10-18 14:59:33	kweaver	I think the idea is good though matthewspeak
2013-10-18 15:00:02	kweaver	theres definitely a pretty huge market for drone related apps and services
2013-10-18 15:00:03	matthewspeak	so what technologies make it better?  location?
2013-10-18 15:00:30	kweaver	what do you mean?
2013-10-18 15:00:37	matthewspeak	i don't know
2013-10-18 15:01:23	-->	jchaike (~jchaike@74-92-113-46-Philadelphia.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #orderdeck
2013-10-18 15:01:24	beadyox	hahahah
2013-10-18 15:01:27	kweaver	the problem with drone related services, is that its technically illegal to fly a drone over houses and streets
2013-10-18 15:01:34	matthewspeak	i'm asking how it works.  what is ideal about drones?  it is the ability to locate exact coordinates? other technologies?
2013-10-18 15:02:38	beadyox	cost and speed?
2013-10-18 15:02:53	kweaver	Id say its the fact that they combine technologies that have been forever in the making
2013-10-18 15:02:59	kweaver	and are finally at a price point
2013-10-18 15:03:02	kweaver	where anyone can buy one
2013-10-18 15:03:07	kweaver	tommyvyo:  has a sick drone
2013-10-18 15:03:36	kweaver	hes got an AR drone
2013-10-18 15:03:42	kweaver	dunno if he broke it though
2013-10-18 15:05:32	beadyox	didn't he break it the week he got it
2013-10-18 15:05:43	kweaver	yeah, but I thought he was going to fix it

2013-10-18 15:30:02	jhartigan	the nd was on sale whe i got mine
2013-10-18 15:30:27	kweaver	k jhartigan  just bought the attached antennae one.  if I set up my static IP, do you mind helping me with the openwrt?
2013-10-18 15:30:37	kweaver	im sure i could look it up, but youd probably be faster with it
2013-10-18 15:30:39	jhartigan	yeah sure
2013-10-18 15:30:44	jhartigan	its pretty sweet
2013-10-18 15:31:03	jhartigan	you just ssh into it then install luic
2013-10-18 15:31:08	jhartigan	luci*
2013-10-18 15:31:30	jhartigan	but then i found configuring it via ssh was easier than some of the visual shit ahah
2013-10-18 15:32:06	kweaver	fuckin google shares $1000
2013-10-18 15:32:12	kweaver	they need to fucking split
2013-10-18 15:32:31	kweaver	I was considering buying a share when it was at $500, but I wanted to diversify my portfolio a bit
2013-10-18 15:33:14	jchaike	gtfo ONE THOUSAND
2013-10-18 15:33:28	kweaver	theyre crazy
2013-10-18 15:33:39	kweaver	and I wish they would just split like twice in a row
2013-10-18 15:33:49	kweaver	so I could afford to buy more than two shares
2013-10-18 15:39:52	beadyox	still worth it haha
2013-10-18 15:40:31	jchaike	their trend is just...UP lol
2013-10-18 15:40:47	beadyox	i like apple
2013-10-18 15:40:59	jchaike	agreed lol
2013-10-18 15:41:04	beadyox	its cheaper
2013-10-18 15:41:18	beadyox	i bought 10 shares of that awhile ago haha
2013-10-18 15:43:47	kweaver	I remember when I could afford to throw $10k around for funzies...
2013-10-18 15:43:54	jchaike	ive been playing this stock game where you join a game and get fake money to play around with stocks
2013-10-18 15:43:57	kweaver	^that never happened
2013-10-18 15:44:05	kweaver	^im broke
2013-10-18 15:44:10	jchaike	lmao
2013-10-18 15:44:33	jchaike	im going to invest all my money in RIM or BBM or whatever they call themselves these days
2013-10-18 15:44:34	jchaike	lo
2013-10-18 15:44:35	jchaike	l
2013-10-18 15:45:22	beadyox	i got 100 shares of Facebook before
2013-10-18 15:45:44	beadyox	it went down and i was thinking well poop oh well ill hold on to it for the long term, now its back up for no reason
2013-10-18 15:45:55	jchaike	im surprised disney stock isnt higher
2013-10-18 15:46:26	jchaike	like its the highest its ever been, but i thougt it was worth so much more
2013-10-18 15:47:14	beadyox	has more to do with market cap than price of the stock really
2013-10-18 15:49:20	jchaike	ohh
2013-10-18 15:49:26	jchaike	yeah i dont really know all that much about stocks lol
2013-10-18 15:49:37	jchaike	id like to learn more though, thats why i play those fake trading games lol
2013-10-18 15:50:47	beadyox	well the market cap will tell you the overall value of the company and when you look at the size of a company you'd look at that rather than price because price can sometimes be misleading
2013-10-18 15:51:03	beadyox	market cap = # shares x price of the stock
2013-10-18 15:51:26	jchaike	ohh
2013-10-18 15:51:37	jchaike	so theres like a finite number of stock per company?
2013-10-18 15:51:39	beadyox	so for example Stock A could have 100 shares and sell for $10 but Stock B could have 10 shares and sell for $100
2013-10-18 15:51:50	beadyox	both have a market cap of $10,000
2013-10-18 15:51:56	beadyox	$1,000**
2013-10-18 15:52:06	beadyox	yes
2013-10-18 15:52:11	beadyox	thats what gives it value
2013-10-18 15:52:20	beadyox	its usually in the millions but it is finite
2013-10-18 15:52:35	beadyox	and people buying and selling that finite amount is what will drive it up or down
2013-10-18 15:53:10	jchaike	lmao someone just said this on an IRC channel im in, i hope he posts a screenshot
2013-10-18 15:53:10	jchaike	 I just installed my windows fonts on Elementary. *YOU WOULDN'T STEAL A CAR, A HANDBAG, A TELEVISION, A MOVIE, or windows fonts?*
2013-10-18 15:53:40	beadyox	hahahah what
2013-10-18 15:54:17	beadyox	investopedia is a pretty good glossary of everything for stocks and what not
2013-10-18 15:54:26	beadyox	how much have you gotten into it so far?
2013-10-18 15:54:37	matthewspeak	man i need to learn more about stocks
2013-10-18 15:54:56	jchaike	i just play around with companys that i read about in the news, and base my selling and buying off that way
2013-10-18 15:54:59	jchaike	in my simulator games
2013-10-18 15:55:30	beadyox	honestly its not a bad strategy
2013-10-18 15:55:38	jchaike	like i know thats not totally correct
2013-10-18 15:55:40	beadyox	because that way you end up with the best of breed companies
2013-10-18 15:55:43	jchaike	i know theres so much more to it than that
2013-10-18 15:55:56	jchaike	butlike in my stock game
2013-10-18 15:56:08	jchaike	im totally going to buy apple stock monday, because their keynote is the 22nsd
2013-10-18 15:56:26	jchaike	and teyre prolly gonna anounce new ipad, new ipad mini, new macbook pros, and release date for mac pro
2013-10-18 15:56:40	jchaike	and hold onto the stock till mid november maybe when everything is out, and then sell
2013-10-18 15:56:44	beadyox	there was a study done a long time ago where they essentially determined that the people who try their best to always search for the best stock, buying and selling daily make the least money while housewives who buy and sell stocks once every ten years or whatever make the most money
2013-10-18 15:57:01	jchaike	lmao why is that
2013-10-18 15:57:13	matthewspeak	i can see that
2013-10-18 15:57:46	beadyox	because you end up just trading too much
2013-10-18 15:57:54	beadyox	you never stick around for a decent profit
2013-10-18 15:58:32	beadyox	if you just bought the five best looking companies on the market today though, in ten years, 2 might be bankrupt, 2 might best around even, and 1 might be gangbusters
2013-10-18 15:58:46	beadyox	so you end up making more money that way even if you lose it all in 2
2013-10-18 15:58:57	jchaike	i feel like thats especially true with tech companies
2013-10-18 15:59:04	beadyox	because the most you can lose is your investment but the sky is the limit for profits
2013-10-18 15:59:39	beadyox	always remember its a zero sum game though: your gain is somebody else's loss and vice versa
2013-10-18 15:59:42	beadyox	it keeps you humble
2013-10-18 16:00:17	jchaike	yeah i mean its just the same as gambling lol
2013-10-18 16:00:27	jchaike	like you can "win" tons of money
2013-10-18 16:00:34	jchaike	but you need to be prepared to lose all the money you put in
2013-10-18 16:00:40	beadyox	exactly
2013-10-18 16:00:53	beadyox	what you can do with stocks though is throw in a fail-safe
2013-10-18 16:01:12	beadyox	you can set it to sell your stock automatically when it goes below 10% loss
2013-10-18 16:01:20	beadyox	that way you take out the emotional component
2013-10-18 16:01:26	jchaike	oh hmm thats cool
2013-10-18 16:01:31	beadyox	cause if you don't you're going to keep telling yourself it'll come back
2013-10-18 16:01:37	beadyox	and sometimes it doesnt
2013-10-18 16:01:47	beadyox	thats called a stop
2013-10-18 16:02:16	beadyox	they also have trailing stops which will never let it go below a set percentage of your current market price
2013-10-18 16:02:47	beadyox	I've lost a lot of obey not heeding this advice, so you should definitely keep it in mind haha
2013-10-18 16:06:27	beadyox	you can also trade stock options
2013-10-18 16:06:34	beadyox	which are cheaper and worth more money
2013-10-18 16:12:13	jchaike	hmm
2013-10-18 16:12:26	jchaike	yeah i might like buy a book and just read about all these different stock terms and such
2013-10-18 16:13:45	beadyox	i don't know what kind of a learner you are

2013-10-21 10:51:23	jchaike	you think the keyboard draws that much power?
2013-10-21 10:51:26	jchaike	i guess if youre using hte USB port
2013-10-21 10:51:27	kweaver1	okay so probably 1.8
2013-10-21 10:51:29	--	Gu_______ is now known as beadyox
2013-10-21 10:51:40	kweaver1	but I really havent noticed anything less than what feels like 2x
2013-10-21 10:52:19	jhartigan	with low power bluetooth available its definitely less efficient that a battery for each in terms of power use, but youd get more overall power by sharing
2013-10-21 10:52:21	jhartigan	so its def more
2013-10-21 10:52:25	jchaike	this 64-bit desktop at work, cannot handle 64-bit photoshop... i get black images thats so annoyign
2013-10-21 10:53:05	jhartigan	windows and PS suck
2013-10-21 10:53:11	kweaver1	woah woah jhartigan how big is your bitsync folder?
2013-10-21 10:53:18	kweaver1	i was wondering why I just hit 2TB today
2013-10-21 10:53:22	kweaver1	im at 108 GB
2013-10-21 10:53:26	dtriley4	http://www.gimp.org/
2013-10-21 10:53:48	jhartigan	^
2013-10-21 10:54:09	jhartigan	46.3 gb
2013-10-21 10:54:29	kweaver1	yeah my .SyncArchive is at 64gb
2013-10-21 10:54:57	kweaver1	i wonder if confussion between OSs could have caused it to think it was empty
2013-10-21 10:55:08	jhartigan	from me removing my mac probably
2013-10-21 10:55:51	kweaver1	uh oh, ive got some recursion going on
2013-10-21 10:58:12	kweaver1	im going to yank my bit syncing and sort this out
2013-10-21 11:01:29	kweaver1	Ive got about 7 nested asset folders
2013-10-21 11:01:31	kweaver1	ill figure it out
2013-10-21 11:01:51	kweaver1	im thinking it was on my end
2013-10-21 11:02:43	kweaver1	originally I just had the one bit sync folder, then when we got the second one for documents, I put them both in a folder called bitsync on ubuntu
2013-10-21 11:02:50	kweaver1	but upon turning on windows this morning
2013-10-21 11:02:55	kweaver1	that change wasnt reflected
2013-10-21 11:03:24	jhartigan	yeah nesting syncs is probably not a good idea
2013-10-21 11:03:27	kweaver1	so it kept putting the full folder structure inside of the root bitsync folder
2013-10-21 11:03:51	kweaver1	yeah, they werent nested syncs, it was because I didnt update it in windows quick enough
2013-10-21 11:03:54	ericmazzola	matthewspeak: it is our friend Dave and Sunny's wedding

2013-10-23 11:17:17	jfortunato	have you had problems getting a gui on arch?
2013-10-23 11:18:30	jchaike	nah ive played around with arch but only on a vm
2013-10-23 11:19:05	jchaike	im too much of a linux noob to handle arch in real life lol
2013-10-23 11:19:48	jfortunato	lol i think its mostly just the install process that people have trouble with
2013-10-23 11:20:48	jchaike	yeah its totally the install process.. even with all the guides in the world, its still not too easy, theres so many incompatibilities
2013-10-23 11:21:21	Koreanderson	jchaike: i had wubi on my computer for a while
2013-10-23 11:21:29	Koreanderson	it was really easy to install and get rid of
2013-10-23 11:21:48	jchaike	awesome, totally just gonna go for that then lol
2013-10-23 11:21:50	Koreanderson	i just ended up switching to a virtual box
2013-10-23 11:22:04	jchaike	i feel like ill just never get good performance on a vm

2013-10-23 11:22:20	Koreanderson	yeah it's get's a bit sluggish sometimes
2013-10-23 11:22:34	Koreanderson	i mean i guess it depends what you're doing
2013-10-23 11:22:50	Koreanderson	i liked wubi though
2013-10-23 11:22:52	Koreanderson	it was cool

2013-10-23 16:21:53	kweaver	I dunno about you, but when I plan a vacay, I dont usually think to have a 4th back up
2013-10-23 16:22:17	kweaver	so then we scrambled for another hour just trying to book something with a roof in the greater boston area
2013-10-23 16:28:08	kweaver	at the end of the day though... we might have 3 extra tickets

2013-10-23 16:37:24	jhartigan	they either referenced dev links or theres two clients that left our hosting for "web marketing and shitty sites"
2013-10-23 16:37:27	matthewspeak	do you guys hand them off once they are done?
2013-10-23 16:37:36	jhartigan	if the client wants to update it sure

2013-10-23 17:00:58	ericmazzola	it's just DNN now
2013-10-23 17:01:01	ericmazzola	it's a CMS
2013-10-23 17:01:05	ericmazzola	like Wordpress
2013-10-23 17:01:08	ericmazzola	or Drupal
2013-10-23 17:01:15	ericmazzola	it's bigger than drupal now ;)
2013-10-23 17:02:35	matthewspeak	i have no say over that stuff haha
2013-10-23 17:02:41	matthewspeak	nor do i know shit about it
2013-10-23 17:03:17	jhartigan	dnns cool but costs way too much
2013-10-23 17:03:19	ericmazzola	DNN is really suited for larger corporations
2013-10-23 17:03:35	jhartigan	i can do just as much for so much less with opensource
2013-10-23 17:03:37	matthewspeak	hmm ok

2013-10-23 17:03:56	ericmazzola	and yeah - everything is mad expensive because corporations are willing to throw that money around
2013-10-23 17:04:03	ericmazzola	DNN is oepnsource
2013-10-23 17:05:01	kweaver	DNN is probably a great CMS, the problem is that it's an all or nothing game.  all other CMS's can be run off of any linux server.  so you can run a magento, joomla, wordpress, drupal, and every other site you could ever want all happily together
2013-10-23 17:05:05	kweaver	if you want to play with DNN
2013-10-23 17:05:08	kweaver	you need a server just for it
2013-10-23 17:05:17	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-23 17:05:43	kweaver	so I have no doubt that its a pretty great cms
2013-10-23 17:06:06	kweaver	but if you want to use it, then you are a DNN dev and nothing else
2013-10-23 17:06:15	jhartigan	dnn can be open source but it cant run on opensource
2013-10-23 17:06:25	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-23 17:06:28	jhartigan	windows servers are generally at best 3x a unix server
2013-10-23 17:06:36	jhartigan	im glad they changed their name though
2013-10-23 17:06:45	jhartigan	cause dot net nuke sounded so much like an exploit
2013-10-23 17:07:31	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-10-23 17:07:51	ericmazzola	the rebrand made it look a LOT more desirable
2013-10-23 17:08:30	ericmazzola	but yeah i agree with you guys
2013-10-23 17:08:39	ericmazzola	it's def an all-or-nothing thing

2013-10-26 18:37:34	@tommyvyo	<#Array:234902342 [#User89324, #User892349285] #>
2013-10-26 18:37:56	@tommyvyo	cause its embedding the return value (which is a User array) of .each in the output html
2013-10-26 18:38:17	@tommyvyo	tldr if its ruby code <% %>, if its going to be a string output of any type <%= %>
2013-10-26 18:38:31	@tommyvyo	<%= link_to <%= form_for
2013-10-26 18:38:38	@tommyvyo	any ruby link helpers go in <%=

2013-10-26 18:40:33	kweaver	why not
2013-10-26 18:40:37	@tommyvyo	your view should not ever query the database
2013-10-26 18:40:52	kweaver	ohh
2013-10-26 18:40:53	@tommyvyo	your controller querys the database and feeds the view
2013-10-26 18:40:56	kweaver	so do that in the controller
2013-10-26 18:40:59	@tommyvyo	the view knows nothing of a database
2013-10-26 18:41:00	kweaver	and then give the view @users
2013-10-26 18:41:02	kweaver	right?
2013-10-26 18:41:05	@tommyvyo	right

2013-10-26 18:41:09	kweaver	im good
2013-10-26 18:42:48	kweaver	is there any security impact to that as well, or just poor application design?

2013-10-26 18:47:54	@tommyvyo	ye
2013-10-26 18:47:56	@tommyvyo	yes
2013-10-26 18:47:57	@tommyvyo	there is
2013-10-26 18:48:06	@tommyvyo	because
2013-10-26 18:48:29	@tommyvyo	the security impact being that if you make such a poor application design youre bound to be vulnerable in some other way so dont do it
2013-10-26 18:49:20	kweaver	I guess my question is
2013-10-26 18:50:02	kweaver	do database -> view connections inherently impose any thread?
2013-10-26 18:50:27	kweaver	I see why its really bad design practice
2013-10-26 18:51:32	kweaver	I guess if anything, it allows clientside access to all the user data, right?

2013-10-26 18:53:28	@tommyvyo	if ur gonna queryi t in the view ur gonna query it in the controller still

2013-10-27 16:07:26	kweaver	its my understanding that you should use seed to populate all the bare necessities, and then individual tasks if you need to test certain functionality
2013-10-27 16:07:58	kweaver	in a dev environment, I guess you could just seed entirely

2013-10-27 16:32:23	@tommyvyo	you can also use seed dump
2013-10-27 16:32:33	@tommyvyo	to input ur own data and then dump the current state of the DB to a seed file
2013-10-27 16:34:43	kweaver	damn thats kinda cool tommyvyo 
2013-10-27 16:34:56	kweaver	tommyvyo: question
2013-10-27 16:35:06	kweaver	if I wanted to write a 3rd party gem
2013-10-27 16:35:52	@tommyvyo	yea
2013-10-27 16:35:57	kweaver	how would you go about using it
2013-10-27 16:36:02	kweaver	like
2013-10-27 16:36:14	kweaver	without cloning my repo
2013-10-27 16:36:24	kweaver	you would use it just be putting it in your gem file
2013-10-27 16:36:30	kweaver	and use it
2013-10-27 16:36:38	@tommyvyo	you would put it on github and rubygems.org
2013-10-27 16:38:32	kweaver	so rubygems.org decides whos cool enough?  or is that a free for all?
2013-10-27 16:39:51	@tommyvyo	its a free for all
2013-10-27 16:39:59	@tommyvyo	id just put it on github
2013-10-27 16:40:20	@tommyvyo	gem 'my_gem', git: "https://github.com/tommyvyo/my_gem.git"
2013-10-27 16:41:09	kweaver	but would just putting it on github mean that you would have to pull it before using it in your gemfile?
2013-10-27 16:42:20	kweaver	or does ruby automatically check github for it?
2013-10-27 16:42:49	kweaver	sorry this is noob question weekend, I guess that was just one aspect of gems I wasnt sure about
2013-10-27 16:49:15	@tommyvyo	bundler
2013-10-27 16:49:23	kweaver	err thats what I meant
2013-10-27 16:49:31	@tommyvyo	http://bundler.io/
2013-10-27 16:49:38	kweaver	so bundler checks github and rubygems.org?
2013-10-27 16:49:48	@tommyvyo	after you install ruby the first thing u install is bundler gem
2013-10-27 16:49:58	@tommyvyo	then when you do bundle install bundler reads ur gemfile
2013-10-27 16:50:25	@tommyvyo	by default it opts to rubygems.org but u can host ur own ruby gem server
2013-10-27 16:50:31	@tommyvyo	so then it would check rubygems.org
2013-10-27 16:51:01	@tommyvyo	if ur gem line specifys github, it will obvz use git to clone it and then it will use that
2013-10-27 16:51:29	kweaver	ah makes sense

2013-10-27 23:01:33	kweaver	just codezin
2013-10-27 23:01:35	kweaver	dude
2013-10-27 23:01:47	kweaver	everytime I come across instances of rails magic
2013-10-27 23:01:50	kweaver	it excited me
2013-10-27 23:01:57	kweaver	excites**
2013-10-27 23:02:04	kweaver	in many ways
2013-10-27 23:02:39	kweaver	I just refactored this loop on the users index page
2013-10-27 23:02:51	kweaver	INTO A RENDER @USERS LINE
2013-10-27 23:04:49	@tommyvyo	Be weary of magic
2013-10-27 23:04:58	@tommyvyo	It is only magic after all
2013-10-27 23:05:17	kweaver	yeah def
2013-10-27 23:05:26	kweaver	i was afraid to even delete what I had originally
2013-10-27 23:05:28	@tommyvyo	Code that reads exactly as and where it's doing is better than magic any day
2013-10-27 23:05:50	kweaver	for fear of not remembering everything that the render is doing for me
2013-10-27 23:06:33	kweaver	maybe ill just throw a comment in there for now so I know my roots
2013-10-27 23:06:55	kweaver	you there dtriley4 ?

2013-10-28 10:02:41	jchaike	thers a small team of people called "evasi0n" and its made up of some well known iphone developers in the jailbreak community, and they have exploits and we just have to wait around for them to perfect the jailbreak so its compeltely user friendly without any issues and then its released
2013-10-28 10:03:47	kweaver	nice ericmazzola

2013-10-28 11:08:38	ericmazzola	i was never really a huge fan
2013-10-28 11:08:46	ericmazzola	but i really like this
2013-10-28 11:09:20	ericmazzola	I've really been digging the genre meshing of some of the more popular electronic bands
2013-10-28 11:09:38	ericmazzola	like how daft punk's new album was heavily tied to funk
2013-10-28 11:09:50	ericmazzola	and disco
2013-10-28 11:11:37	kweaver	so apparently all new buildings built in philadelphia will now be required to have gender neutral bathrooms
2013-10-28 11:12:08	kweaver	from a LGBT bill that passed thursday
2013-10-28 11:12:10	kweaver	lol
2013-10-28 11:12:12	jhartigan	so coed?
2013-10-28 11:12:45	kweaver	so people dont have to feel like they need to pick a gender every time they pee

2013-10-28 11:13:23	jhartigan	i get that.. but like you now either have to allow coed or have 2 - 20 single rooms depending on establishment size
2013-10-28 11:14:23	jchaike	what was the point of that bill? they actually decided "GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOMS ARE A PRESSING ISSUE!"
2013-10-28 11:14:27	jchaike	"WE MUST DEAL WITH IT NOW!"

2013-10-28 11:14:55	ericmazzola	that just sounds like lawsuits waiting to happen
2013-10-28 11:14:56	jhartigan	i mean they are.  at least from the internet ive learned that alot of the trans people take offense to many thing.. some rightfully so, some you need to get over
2013-10-28 11:16:27	kweaver	Im cool with being fair and all, but thats alotttt of extra money
2013-10-28 11:17:27	jhartigan	i totally agree. also if youre transgender, and no offense, but go in the bathroom you now look like.. i dont know anyone thatd say "excuse me, please whip it out for entry
2013-10-28 11:17:58	jchaike	lmao
2013-10-28 11:18:08	jchaike	and nobodys going to question you if you a man in womens clothing
2013-10-28 11:20:44	kweaver	"Neither gay marriage nor civil unions are legal in Pennsylvania, and the state has a law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman."
2013-10-28 11:20:59	jhartigan	yeah PA is the only state in the northeast where its not legal
2013-10-28 11:20:59	kweaver	I would take a guess and say that law carrys more importance
2013-10-28 11:21:41	kweaver	and I would even take the guess to say that most LGBT's feel the same way
2013-10-28 11:21:52	jchaike	i think it comes down to penis is men vagina is woman, and thats the bathroom you belong to...
2013-10-28 11:22:19	jchaike	and then outside of the stall you can identify yourself as whatever you want
2013-10-28 11:22:30	jhartigan	nah thats not how transgender peoples work jchaike.  theyre complicated, within their rights
2013-10-28 11:22:45	jchaike	but its not like mens bathrooms only have urinals... so if you feel like you should do women things and sit and pee, feel free to
2013-10-28 11:22:49	jchaike	nobodys gonna say anything to you
2013-10-28 11:26:18	kweaver	how about instead of mandating that an additional 8-10% of all construction costs be cut from the bugdet and reallocated to additional bathrooms in every building, we just dont judge and pass a law that lets them get married.
2013-10-28 11:26:33	kweaver	booooooom
2013-10-28 11:27:03	@tommyvyo	thats only for city-owned buildings
2013-10-28 11:27:49	@tommyvyo	if anything it just says that philadelphia is more tolerant of it than other places, which is a nice thing to do
2013-10-28 11:27:50	kweaver	well thats better then
2013-10-28 11:28:27	@tommyvyo	lol
2013-10-28 11:28:46	jchaike	i was acutally reading that now that its legal in more places, yeah its more tolerated, but gay couples dont want to get married, because its not very cost effective
2013-10-28 11:29:05	jchaike	like your taxes and shit go up and whatever and its more expensive to be married living together than "single" living together
2013-10-28 11:29:11	@tommyvyo	y'all are puttin to much thought into a bathroom without a picture of a man or a women in the door
2013-10-28 11:29:27	jchaike	thats a very personal time for me lmao
2013-10-28 11:29:34	@tommyvyo	lol

2013-10-28 11:34:06	kweaver	now whenever I open vim im getting "cant open file /usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax/syntax.vim"
2013-10-28 11:34:07	jhartigan	i think vim tries to process it.
2013-10-28 11:34:17	kweaver	because my syntax.vim file is just gone
2013-10-28 11:34:37	jhartigan	well get vim 7.4... though im sure youll have to build it yourself given ubuntu wont deem it stable until 2015
2013-10-28 11:34:46	jhartigan	i dunno though. thats a tough one

2013-10-28 11:36:28	jhartigan	syntax.vim is mighty small
2013-10-28 11:37:26	kweaver	jhartigan it looks like the added 7.4 do the default repos in 13.10
2013-10-28 11:37:38	jhartigan	ooooh man
2013-10-28 11:37:40	jhartigan	good for them
2013-10-28 11:37:59	jhartigan	yeah remove your vim and install it from the repo than
2013-10-28 11:38:03	jhartigan	should fix it id think

2013-10-28 12:05:59	jhartigan	    So, does Vim manage projects too or do I have to mess with the files manually?
2013-10-28 12:05:59	jchaike	im also reading to go "old school" and cut out some stuff with scissors and wireframe by hand lol http://www.mstoner.com/blog/uncategorized/pwireframing_paper_wireframing/

2013-10-28 12:09:28	kweaver	lol jchaike do whatever you want with the wireframes
2013-10-28 12:09:37	kweaver	ill helped you get started and outline all the pages
2013-10-28 12:09:40	kweaver	from there is on you
2013-10-28 12:09:45	kweaver	jhartigan:  lolololol
2013-10-28 12:10:01	kweaver	I like reading about people first learning of vim
2013-10-28 12:10:10	kweaver	it reminds me of when I first learned about vim
2013-10-28 12:10:13	kweaver	and almost threw up
2013-10-28 12:10:28	jhartigan	yeah.. but i dont think i was confused by what it was
2013-10-28 12:10:39	jhartigan	i always knew it was evil
2013-10-28 12:10:50	jhartigan	and now ive embraced that evil for all its greasy goodness
2013-10-28 12:15:26	kweaver	well when you first see it, you wonder "if I were given 1 year and the task of over-complicating something as simple as typing, would I even come close to the complexities of vim?"
2013-10-28 12:15:52	jchaike	^ thats how i feel ^ lol
2013-10-28 12:15:56	jchaike	but its slowly growing on me
2013-10-28 12:16:06	kweaver	but then you realize that its not over-complification
2013-10-28 12:16:25	jchaike	the amount of times i just START typing before i INSERT is uncountable
2013-10-28 12:16:49	kweaver	and that hiding underneath a scary exterior, lies a massive cave of wonderful exploration
2013-10-28 12:17:09	kweaver	and that every road leads to more and more efficient means of typing
2013-10-28 12:17:47	kweaver	i think it was a huge help that kilroy used it on a daily basis in front of the class
2013-10-28 12:18:19	kweaver	that gave such good insight into what it would be like to get good at vim
2013-10-28 12:18:22	jchaike	you had a class where vim was used? and not bluejay? lol
2013-10-28 12:18:55	kweaver	yeah kilroy is a mans man
2013-10-28 12:19:29	kweaver	the whole class was in the terminal
2013-10-28 12:19:37	jchaike	wow thats cool haha
2013-10-28 12:21:09	jhartigan	that darren provine

2013-10-28 12:21:16	jhartigan	pimpster extraordinaire

2013-10-31 16:29:42	jchaike	can i just delete the .dotfiles
2013-10-31 16:30:07	kweaver_laptop	so josh
2013-10-31 16:30:22	kweaver_laptop	the way most people have their dotfiles site up
2013-10-31 16:30:30	kweaver_laptop	you create a hidden folder called .dotfiles
2013-10-31 16:30:38	kweaver_laptop	that houses all of your settings and config files
2013-10-31 16:30:49	kweaver_laptop	make it a repo 
2013-10-31 16:31:06	kweaver_laptop	and then you symlink those individual files out to the ~/   directory
2013-10-31 16:31:16	@tommyvyo	y'all are whack why ya hiding your dotfiles folder?
2013-10-31 16:31:44	kweaver_laptop	that way, your computer thinks you have the file in the home directory, but its really just running it from the .dotfiles directory
2013-10-31 16:31:46	jhartigan	second lesson of the day jchaike -> make your own config. its cool to get ideas and help, but best to make it to your liking and youll learn it better
2013-10-31 16:32:04	jhartigan	im a creature of habit tommyvyo ... my home directory is neater than my goddamn room
2013-10-31 16:32:06	jchaike	i just want to use someones config so i can at least have one lol
2013-10-31 16:32:19	kweaver_laptop	yeah tommyvyo I hide mine as well

2013-11-01 09:57:29	jchaike	not too much, i just drove through a monsoon lol
2013-11-01 09:57:39	jchaike	but only a 20 second monsoon so it was tolerable
2013-11-01 09:58:57	kweaver	did you get a feel for proto jchaike?
2013-11-01 09:59:18	jchaike	yeah i have been playing around with it, creating that "home site" for heroes
2013-11-01 09:59:35	jchaike	i was looking to share it with you, but thatts not an option to share between AdobeIDs
2013-11-01 09:59:43	kweaver	yeah thats dumb
2013-11-01 10:01:03	jchaike	but kweaver heres a link to it
2013-11-01 10:01:03	jchaike	http://adobe.ly/16RN99M
2013-11-01 10:01:12	jchaike	ADOBELY
2013-11-01 10:01:43	kweaver	it looks like it only lets me download it
2013-11-01 10:02:21	kweaver	its a .pro so I guess id have to open that from proto somehow
2013-11-01 10:02:37	jchaike	i guess via email lmao
2013-11-01 10:03:23	kweaver	ill check it out another time
2013-11-01 10:03:44	kweaver	i figure next time we go to sbucks, you and I could look it over
2013-11-01 10:05:25	jchaike	okay sure
2013-11-01 10:05:47	jchaike	its not a vital mockup anyway, just thought if i was to play around with proto might as well work on something that could possibly be used later

2013-11-02 14:06:54	beadyox	and go for it i mean start the business
2013-11-02 14:07:25	beadyox	I'm working on branding at this point, like how do i want to market it

2013-11-02 14:16:56	beadyox	ok
2013-11-02 14:17:17	beadyox	as for location i think it would have to be inner city
2013-11-02 14:17:31	beadyox	or smaller upper income neighborhood such as collingswood or haddonfield
2013-11-02 14:18:28	beadyox	i was having this long discussion last night with my sister about it because i don't really know what to do with brand/marketing at this point with it since it is ice cream
2013-11-02 14:19:27	beadyox	you know what i mean? my product will be healthy, made with honey so its low glycemic index (i.e. diabetic friendly) and hopefully organic and non GMO ingredients as well
2013-11-02 14:20:13	beadyox	but the thing is my sister was saying you have to target a specific market which i agree with in most cases, but i feel like when you're talking about a food product, its slightly different
2013-11-02 14:22:20	beadyox	so you know how you have all your fast food places? you have mcdnalds wendys chick fil a, burger king, etc and then you have chipotle which has some organic and locally sourced ingredients, now their target market is truly people who want to eat a simple and delicious mexican meal while being conscious about where the ingredients come from, but ultimately since its fast food, everyone who eats fast food is going to try it
2013-11-02 14:22:20	beadyox	 at some point or another, the only factor preventing people from trying it is price
2013-11-02 14:22:56	beadyox	whatever comments you have kweaver_laptop
2013-11-02 14:23:01	beadyox	i'm still basing it out
2013-11-02 14:29:35	beadyox	kweaver_laptop
2013-11-02 14:29:35	beadyox	kweaver_laptop
2013-11-02 14:29:36	beadyox	kweaver_laptop
2013-11-02 14:29:37	kweaver_laptop	so I would say your target market in this case would be a health concious, generally younger audience, 
2013-11-02 14:29:37	beadyox	=p
2013-11-02 14:30:04	beadyox	yeah exactly, so i was thinking that and then the diabetic friendly thing is an added benefit to add on the product
2013-11-02 14:30:19	beadyox	kind of like how some products say "Oh look, we're also vegan!"
2013-11-02 14:31:03	kweaver_laptop	yeah, I would definitely make that the staple to your brand
2013-11-02 14:31:21	kweaver_laptop	one aspect
2013-11-02 14:31:24	kweaver_laptop	that fuckin
2013-11-02 14:31:27	kweaver_laptop	everyone ignores
2013-11-02 14:31:33	kweaver_laptop	when it comes to icecream
2013-11-02 14:31:49	kweaver_laptop	is lactose free
2013-11-02 14:32:39	kweaver_laptop	if you go to shoprite, or any where else, danielle and I are limited to a couple frozen yogurt flavors, and then the usual vanilla/chocolate lactaid brand ice cream
2013-11-02 14:32:53	kweaver_laptop	but lactose free milk tastes EXACTLY THE SAME as regular milk
2013-11-02 14:33:24	kweaver_laptop	so it would be amazing if there were a brand of icecream, with all the usual flavors, but zero lactose
2013-11-02 14:36:34	beadyox	i am experimenting heavily with making ice creams from coconut milk ;)
2013-11-02 14:37:00	beadyox	so i can cover two bases at once (vegetarian and lactose intolerance) BAM
2013-11-02 14:37:23	beadyox	is there organic lactose free cream at shop right?
2013-11-02 14:38:29	kweaver_laptop	your brand needs to acknowledge the fact that ice cream is an inherently unhealthy desert. your brand should not try to trick people that you are offering some secret, truly healthy option that you should eat every day.  just be modest and transparent.  people like companies with transparency.  brand your product as a step in the right direction, not the fountain of youth
2013-11-02 14:38:53	kweaver_laptop	and no, I dont think so
2013-11-02 14:40:47	beadyox	yeah of course, anything in excess isn't great
2013-11-02 14:41:16	beadyox	but a coconut milk flavor would fit within the context of a really healthy diet
2013-11-02 14:41:29	kweaver_laptop	you might want to check out your options at whole foods
2013-11-02 14:41:32	kweaver_laptop	to give you ideas
2013-11-02 14:41:36	kweaver_laptop	of whats available
2013-11-02 14:41:50	beadyox	id put something out there like "i won't serve you anything i wouldn't eat"
2013-11-02 14:42:01	kweaver_laptop	yeah I like the coconut milk idea too
2013-11-02 14:44:37	beadyox	it makes a pretty awesome gelato but i need to see how it freezes with liquid nitrogen
2013-11-02 14:47:18	beadyox	the only other thing thats worrisome that my sister was saying is that its hard to get regular people to eat healthy
2013-11-02 14:47:35	beadyox	like if you tell someone its healthy or diabetic friendly they think it tastes like crap and won't try it
2013-11-02 14:48:14	beadyox	I'm thinking maybe just marketing it as non GMO or organic or something like that is a way of telling people its healthy without labeling it as healthy and attaching the taste stigma to it
2013-11-02 15:07:38	kweaver_laptop	makes sense
2013-11-02 15:08:10	kweaver_laptop	you should def check out whole foods next time you see one
2013-11-02 15:08:11	beadyox	how do you feel about purple and green together
2013-11-02 15:08:17	beadyox	yeah for sure
2013-11-02 15:08:25	kweaver_laptop	I think in terms of location, you might fit well near a whole foods
2013-11-02 15:08:52	kweaver_laptop	beadyox:  https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/most-popular/?time=month
2013-11-02 15:08:59	kweaver_laptop	start with one of those
2013-11-02 15:09:20	kweaver_laptop	or at least use one to guide you
2013-11-02 15:09:48	kweaver_laptop	then for a logo concept, start looking on dribble
2013-11-02 15:09:49	kweaver_laptop	http://dribbble.com/search?q=ice+cream+logo
2013-11-02 15:12:12	kweaver_laptop	if you were to move forward, I assume youd need to approach some investors?
2013-11-02 15:17:45	kweaver_laptop	eh beadyox ?

2013-11-04 10:15:45	ericmazzola	cehck em out
2013-11-04 10:15:51	ericmazzola	japanese instrumental rock band
2013-11-04 10:16:10	ericmazzola	Lite's sound combines the precision and musicianship of prog rock with the emotionally charged cinematic compositions of art rock, in a heavier, more modern package that they describe as “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock”
2013-11-04 10:16:11	matthewspeak	neat
2013-11-04 10:16:21	matthewspeak	ok ill check

2013-11-04 10:28:00	jchaike_	idk how this guy made this stuff, but it sounds slightly "garageband"-esque
2013-11-04 10:28:06	ericmazzola	I've only listened to the first half of Lite's newest album so far
2013-11-04 10:28:15	ericmazzola	I really like it though for background music
2013-11-04 10:29:28	ericmazzola	I would guess zantilla is garageband or logic

2013-11-04 10:41:37	jhartigan	someone figured out NFL doesnt require login for their streams from their ip. so everyone on reddit streams all their games with vlc
2013-11-04 10:42:07	ericmazzola	NHL*

2013-11-04 10:42:47	jchaike_	or they couldnt just .htaccess protect their /streams/ folder or something lmao
2013-11-04 10:42:48	ericmazzola	the nhl hasn't figured out anything really...

2013-11-04 10:43:55	ericmazzola	I have only been able to watch like 3 eagles games down here
2013-11-04 10:43:55	jhartigan	the nfl however, has better sys admins
2013-11-04 10:44:13	beadyox	the nil has more money
2013-11-04 10:44:29	jchaike_	and i cant watch ANY freaking jets games up here lol
2013-11-04 10:44:30	ericmazzola	the only Flyers game I could watch was when we played Florida
2013-11-04 10:44:41	ericmazzola	eww

2013-11-04 10:44:59	ericmazzola	awesome
2013-11-04 10:45:12	jhartigan	if you care about basketball someone can track down the r/nba one
2013-11-04 10:45:37	ericmazzola	nahh
2013-11-04 10:45:46	ericmazzola	although maybe I should
2013-11-04 10:45:53	ericmazzola	since the sixers beat the heat
2013-11-04 10:46:13	jhartigan	#bandwagontime?

2013-11-04 10:46:20	ericmazzola	and the bulls
2013-11-04 10:46:50	jhartigan	i think we can safely say the heats win was a total fluke
2013-11-04 10:47:05	ericmazzola	i didn't watch but everyone here was so pissed the next day

2013-11-04 11:10:20	kweaver	Lee and I were discussing a couple different ideas for this week
2013-11-04 11:10:50	kweaver	instead of doing topics, we wanted to see what the reception would be to the idea of breaking off into groups and doing mini-projects
2013-11-04 11:11:15	kweaver	just throw ideas into a pot to see if anyone else thinks your idea is interesting
2013-11-04 11:11:55	kweaver	I figured MpWilli mpwilli_sexy jhartigan tommyvyo and I could group up first and start discussing that online bill pay app

2013-11-04 12:12:55	kweaver	ericmazzola: beadyox just a google hangout with a bunch of people.  we organized one a couple months agoo
2013-11-04 12:13:48	kweaver	last time we introduced eachother, and talked about vim and different projects that everyone is working on
2013-11-04 12:14:50	kweaver	this thursday, we're gonna discuss difference project ideas that people may have.  Just see if anyone else might be interested in working on the same one
2013-11-04 12:15:15	kweaver	maybe see if we cant organize some people and resources together
2013-11-04 12:15:26	kweaver	and build some fun stuff
2013-11-04 12:16:03	beadyox	why don't you start a business based around that
2013-11-04 12:16:26	kweaver	because Im already trying to start a couple of those
2013-11-04 12:16:29	kweaver	lol
2013-11-04 12:16:35	beadyox	start a third
2013-11-04 12:17:16	kweaver	nah, I mean we've got plenty of resources and people that know how to build shit.  its just a matter of organizing everyone with other people that might be interested in doing the same
2013-11-04 12:17:29	tommyvyo	i dunno if i feel like doing a hackerhang group project
2013-11-04 12:17:33	beadyox	thats the point
2013-11-04 12:17:37	beadyox	i mean
2013-11-04 12:17:52	beadyox	the resources are there to bring everyone together but there isn't a centralized thing
2013-11-04 12:18:04	beadyox	that brings together EVERYONE who would be interested in this kind of thing
2013-11-04 12:18:04	kweaver	tommyvyo, i figure our project would just be to discuss the OD/SS online bill pay app
2013-11-04 12:18:19	beadyox	i'll listen in
2013-11-04 12:18:24	kweaver	yeah beadyox  I agree
2013-11-04 12:18:57	tommyvyo	im cool with that i just dont feel like talking to everyone else in the world about it
2013-11-04 12:19:07	kweaver	yeah thats fine
2013-11-04 12:19:17	kweaver	6 other people wouldnt be everyone else in the world
2013-11-04 12:19:21	beadyox	like imagine the potential behind something like that
2013-11-04 12:19:22	kweaver	but I get what youre putting down
2013-11-04 12:20:12	beadyox	because working from remote locations is becoming more the present and the future and especially people who want to do their own thing
2013-11-04 12:20:40	beadyox	it would be cool to just be able to go to a central place like this and hear some pitches and apply to a couple and have some contract work for a few months or something
2013-11-04 12:20:51	tommyvyo	 that duz sound cool beadyox
2013-11-04 12:21:03	tommyvyo	the problem is, where does that funding come from
2013-11-04 12:21:14	beadyox	you don't even need funding
2013-11-04 12:21:14	kweaver	beadyox oh yeah def.  maybe hook up with a few colleges, see if you can pull together a few people to work on projects.  there is plenty of talent to go around
2013-11-04 12:21:23	kweaver	this IRC channel alone has a solid 15 programmers
2013-11-04 12:21:28	beadyox	because all you're doing is bringing together employers and employees
2013-11-04 12:21:49	beadyox	not to mention the startup capabilities
2013-11-04 12:21:52	kweaver	theres a whole business in just bringing people together
2013-11-04 12:22:32	beadyox	i think there would be a lot of potential
2013-11-04 12:22:43	kweaver	most def
2013-11-04 12:22:50	kweaver	that why I figure we start out small
2013-11-04 12:22:56	kweaver	with our hackerhang
2013-11-04 12:23:01	kweaver	put together a couple projects
2013-11-04 12:23:08	kweaver	see how the formula works
2013-11-04 12:23:54	jhartigan	tommyvyo: can i pick your brain, perhaps your nose, about the nginx proxy pass at some point this day?
2013-11-04 12:24:34	jhartigan	also.. all you ubuntu lovers nagging one me. i cannot build this easily https://github.com/tstack/lnav cause ubuntus automake and autoconf are behind
2013-11-04 12:25:24	kweaver	lol
2013-11-04 12:25:26	kweaver	that stinks
2013-11-04 12:25:53	jhartigan	was gonna install it on the servers
2013-11-04 12:26:02	jhartigan	but now i gotta fucking upgrade them manually
2013-11-04 12:26:07	kweaver	im cool with all distros
2013-11-04 12:26:24	jhartigan	me too. i only rag on them cause i can.
2013-11-04 12:26:28	jhartigan	ubuntus great
2013-11-04 12:26:46	jhartigan	feel free to rag on me for being some 'try hard, or elitest' for arch
2013-11-04 12:26:53	jhartigan	but that built just fine for me!
2013-11-04 12:27:23	kweaver	that works. at least bashing ubuntu is better than saying "youll soon realize that you dont actually like DFH 120 Minute IPA, you just have some growing up to do"
2013-11-04 12:27:28	kweaver	that would be rediculous

2013-11-04 13:53:55	beadyox	at the same time though id rather use a mouse than a point stick
2013-11-04 13:54:54	jharty	yeah id do the same
2013-11-04 13:55:07	beadyox	is midc the best free client for pc
2013-11-04 13:55:26	jharty	pidgin probs
2013-11-04 13:56:05	beadyox	for reals
2013-11-04 13:56:11	beadyox	i have no idea what pidgin is like
2013-11-04 13:56:23	beadyox	i only ever used irc cause thats what tommyvyo told me to use
2013-11-04 13:56:25	jharty	an ugly adium
2013-11-04 13:57:03	kweaver	I use pidgin on my windows beadyox
2013-11-04 13:57:08	kweaver	i would just tell him to grab that
2013-11-04 13:57:28	kweaver	mirc was built in like the 1800s
2013-11-04 13:57:48	kweaver	plus pidgin supports like every chat medium out there
2013-11-04 13:58:02	kweaver	I have my google chat tied into pidgin as well
2013-11-04 13:58:07	kweaver	and my aim
2013-11-04 13:58:11	beadyox	hahahaha
2013-11-04 13:58:22	beadyox	midc was great!
2013-11-04 13:58:26	beadyox	very utilitarian
2013-11-04 13:58:29	beadyox	mirc*
2013-11-04 13:58:37	kweaver	yeah its fine
2013-11-04 13:58:39	beadyox	regardless, i love irc
2013-11-04 13:58:43	kweaver	its just very outdated
2013-11-04 13:58:44	beadyox	i can't believe its not more popular
2013-11-04 13:58:49	kweaver	i agree
2013-11-04 13:58:58	beadyox	is it that much different than textual/
2013-11-04 13:58:59	beadyox	?
2013-11-04 13:59:04	jharty	yeah
2013-11-04 13:59:05	beadyox	midc that is
2013-11-04 13:59:07	beadyox	mirc
2013-11-04 13:59:15	jharty	textual is a quality client.. like very quality
2013-11-04 13:59:26	beadyox	granted I'm sure i don't use any of these to the extent of what they're capable
2013-11-04 13:59:41	beadyox	what else can i use textual for?
2013-11-04 14:00:09	kweaver	the thing is, irc is a very basic chat protocal, so whatever client you choose really doesnt matter.
2013-11-04 14:00:17	kweaver	the added benefit of stuff like textual
2013-11-04 14:00:27	kweaver	is that you get things like embedded images when someone links an img
2013-11-04 14:00:35	kweaver	and probably some other bells and whistles

2013-11-04 14:08:29	jchaike_	i litreally talk to one person on aim lol
2013-11-04 14:08:38	jchaike_	beacuse i hate fb chat
2013-11-04 14:12:59	beadyox	the only reason i have Facebook is to talk to people there
2013-11-04 14:13:02	beadyox	i hate the chat too
2013-11-04 14:15:15	kweaver	yeah sorry to burst the bub jchaike_
2013-11-04 14:15:22	kweaver	i dont use aim
2013-11-04 14:15:27	jchaike_	haha
2013-11-04 14:15:39	jchaike_	i want aim to make a comeback
2013-11-04 14:15:40	jchaike_	lol
2013-11-04 14:15:48	kweaver	who do you talk to on aim?
2013-11-04 14:15:57	kweaver	because you guys have to be the last two users
2013-11-04 14:16:02	jchaike_	literally one friend lol
2013-11-04 14:16:23	jchaike_	yeah we probably are the last two users haha
2013-11-04 14:16:34	jchaike_	because the only other option out there really is FBChat
2013-11-04 14:16:44	jchaike_	and i just cant bring myself to use facebook at all lol
2013-11-04 14:16:54	beadyox	irc is the better version of aim
2013-11-04 14:17:07	jchaike_	irc is way too complex for my friend haha
2013-11-04 14:17:20	jchaike_	like i feel like you need to be somewhat computer literate to fiugre out irc
2013-11-04 14:17:32	beadyox	i used to use aim to talk to my girlfriend but it fell by the wayside after we broke up haha
2013-11-04 14:17:51	jchaike_	haha yeah not even my girlfriend will use aim
2013-11-04 14:17:54	kweaver	I would say google hangouts also aleviates the need for aim
2013-11-04 14:17:57	kweaver	moreso than irc
2013-11-04 14:18:04	beadyox	I've never tried google hangouts
2013-11-04 14:18:16	beadyox	i would though
2013-11-04 14:18:26	kweaver	what email provider do you use?
2013-11-04 14:18:32	jchaike_	but that requires gmail, whereas aim doesnt require any platform other than having an account that is specifically only for the instant messaging platform
2013-11-04 14:18:52	jchaike_	like if you want to hangout you need Gmail AND Google+
2013-11-04 14:19:01	beadyox	i like how everyone would talk about aim chatrooms and crap and were like "OMG its hilarious we were totally messing with this lesbian chat room"...everyone in those chats was probably a troll haha
2013-11-04 14:19:03	beadyox	i use gmail
2013-11-04 14:19:05	kweaver	which are both 1 single account
2013-11-04 14:19:26	kweaver	the difference is that yours is a single account with a single functionality
2013-11-04 14:19:37	jchaike_	i mean kweaver  your defintetly right, im just stuck in my old habbit talking to my friend lol
2013-11-04 14:19:44	jchaike_	like we'll literally text eachother "yo dude go on aim" lol
2013-11-04 14:19:52	kweaver	nah it happens
2013-11-04 14:19:59	kweaver	theres also steam
2013-11-04 14:20:04	beadyox	its the nostalgia jchaike_
2013-11-04 14:20:10	kweaver	yup
2013-11-04 14:20:22	jchaike_	and i like that its integrated into OSX ... iChat (well..messages)
2013-11-04 14:20:29	kweaver	crush up an AOL 1000 free hours CD and snort that shit up
2013-11-04 14:20:31	beadyox	Skype too
2013-11-04 14:20:40	kweaver	eh fuck skype
2013-11-04 14:20:42	beadyox	does Skype do conferences
2013-11-04 14:20:50	kweaver	it was great until microsoft bought it
2013-11-04 14:20:50	beadyox	voice conferences
2013-11-04 14:21:00	jchaike_	lmao AOL CDS.... the best frisbee alternative
2013-11-04 14:21:14	jchaike_	skype is such garbage i cnat even comprehend how it became such crap
2013-11-04 14:21:14	beadyox	i haven't noticed anything change but then again i haven't been paying attention
2013-11-04 14:21:25	jharty	that escalated quickly
2013-11-04 14:21:36	jchaike_	on windows, you literally CANT close it
2013-11-04 14:21:39	kweaver	just last week microsoft announced theyll be closing the public facing skype api
2013-11-04 14:21:42	kweaver	in like 1 month
2013-11-04 14:21:43	jchaike_	its stuck in your goddamn task bar lol
2013-11-04 14:21:50	beadyox	wot

2013-11-04 14:22:28	jchaike_	or if you bought a iOS app that has skype chat integrated
2013-11-04 14:22:37	kweaver	yeah exactly
2013-11-04 14:22:43	kweaver	youre beat street
2013-11-04 14:22:48	kweaver	such a joke
2013-11-04 14:22:57	jchaike_	thats such crap, they're going to like revoke the access even if you already have an app made? or theyre just closing it off for new people to use it
2013-11-04 14:22:58	kweaver	microsoft still makes business decisions like its 1998
2013-11-04 14:23:02	jharty	skypes also wildly insecure
2013-11-04 14:23:07	jharty	not a good chat protocol at all

2013-11-04 14:55:07	jharty	lol okay
2013-11-04 14:55:13	jharty	lol at the overly complicted part
2013-11-04 14:55:21	kweaver	do you want to do a google hangout at some point and go over it?
2013-11-04 14:55:34	jharty	well we should probably get hried before that
2013-11-04 14:56:41	kweaver	hm?
2013-11-04 14:57:53	jharty	i mean unless dleonhardt is doing the hiring, we have to apply for the contract and all
2013-11-04 14:59:03	kweaver	oh yeah, im just talking about having him explain the situation to us
2013-11-04 14:59:14	kweaver	unless he fees like typing it out over irc
2013-11-04 15:00:46	dleonhardt	Just a sec. I'll grab a spec and send it over

2013-11-04 15:02:15	kweaver	I worked with him for a year

2013-11-04 15:03:46	beadyox	pretty soon we're going to have to scroll down to see the list of names in the channel =p

2013-11-04 15:08:15	jharty	who hasnt.. the amount of fucking hulu adds they pay for
2013-11-04 15:08:28	kweaver	yeah foreal
2013-11-04 15:08:56	kweaver	I got some sort of coupon for it in my half marathon goody bag
2013-11-04 15:09:52	beadyox	i think its a great idea
2013-11-04 15:10:08	beadyox	i don't use hulu though haha
2013-11-04 15:10:23	beadyox	i never knew about it until this history podcast i was telling you about earlier
2013-11-04 15:10:39	beadyox	cause at the end of it he talks about audible sponsoring it and crap
2013-11-04 15:11:43	kweaver	yeah its a great idea
2013-11-04 15:11:56	kweaver	$15 a month is just a bit high for me
2013-11-04 15:12:08	kweaver	considering id probably just use it for going on runs and stuff
2013-11-04 15:14:13	beadyox	yeah
2013-11-04 15:14:21	beadyox	but when you think about it
2013-11-04 15:14:31	beadyox	even if you listen to two books, you're at least even
2013-11-04 15:14:57	beadyox	for me it would be worth it with the commute i have now because I'm burning up 7.5 hours a week in driving
2013-11-04 15:15:14	beadyox	we'll see though
2013-11-04 15:26:19	tommyvyo	yo dleonhardt if they dont take it or if you have extra JS contract work
2013-11-04 15:26:23	tommyvyo	<--- this guy'll do it
2013-11-04 15:27:05	dleonhardt	hahahha
2013-11-04 15:27:45	dleonhardt	sure thing man. if kweaver and jharty don't want it I'll send it your way
2013-11-04 15:28:37	dleonhardt	kweaver and jharty: i'm writing up an email for it now. let me know if it seems like something you might be interested in. if not i'll send it to tommyvyo
2013-11-04 15:31:51	dleonhardt	you guys get first dibs though ;)
2013-11-04 15:33:23	jhartigan	haha thanks.. im highly interested
2013-11-04 15:33:58	dleonhardt	ok its sent
2013-11-04 15:34:27	jhartigan	kk ill look at it after im done scolding kweaver for mixing up our dental clients
2013-11-04 15:34:34	jhartigan	jkjk honest mistake on his part
2013-11-04 15:36:53	dleonhardt	yeah i don't know what the pay is for it, but i do know we have a decent amount left to spend before the end of the year
2013-11-04 15:37:06	dleonhardt	so it'll probably be worth it for you guys
2013-11-04 15:38:22	jhartigan	i would think so.. it looks pretty straightforward from what i can tell anyways
2013-11-04 15:41:09	dleonhardt	yeah it will have to comply with graceful degradation and be responsive so it fits mobile and desktop windows equally
2013-11-04 15:41:26	dleonhardt	not terrible. the hardest part about it will be the customization aspects
2013-11-04 15:41:46	dleonhardt	non-technical people will be needing to add and update these
2013-11-04 15:42:19	jhartigan	so its gonna need some sort of gui front end
2013-11-04 15:42:22	jhartigan	gotcha
2013-11-04 15:42:26	dleonhardt	possibly
2013-11-04 15:42:31	dleonhardt	that or html is fine
2013-11-04 15:42:40	jhartigan	oh.. well thats even easier than a front end
2013-11-04 15:43:01	jhartigan	haha. well im cool with it if kweaver is and maybe we can get an interview / application put in on it
2013-11-04 15:43:11	dleonhardt	yeah i think that would be the preferred route
2013-11-04 15:43:47	kweaver	NO TOMMYVYO, I HAVE DIBS ON DLEONHARDT AND HIS WORK
2013-11-04 15:43:54	jhartigan	AND HIS BODY
2013-11-04 15:43:56	dleonhardt	tomorrow i'll send you guys a more detailed version of the word doc i sent
2013-11-04 15:44:02	dleonhardt	it'll make more sense then
2013-11-04 15:44:06	dleonhardt	hahaha kweav
2013-11-04 15:44:45	tommyvyo	ITS OKAY
2013-11-04 15:44:47	tommyvyo	I DONT WANT IT
2013-11-04 15:45:03	tommyvyo	jk i want it
2013-11-04 15:45:48	jhartigan	sounds good dleonhardt   my biggest question is the xml feed.  i assume it just means that means all of its content can be pushed into some xml feed you guys use
2013-11-04 15:48:06	dleonhardt	yeah our content is written in xml and xsl and we license it to partners
2013-11-04 15:48:19	dleonhardt	it just has to work with the way we do our content
2013-11-04 15:48:23	jhartigan	oooh okay. that makes more sense now
2013-11-04 15:48:28	dleonhardt	so it can't conflict with it more or less
2013-11-04 15:48:41	jhartigan	i wasnt aware xml was still used often
2013-11-04 15:48:42	dleonhardt	i'll give you more details about that when it get it though
2013-11-04 15:48:49	jhartigan	yeah thats cool man. much appreciated
2013-11-04 15:48:54	dleonhardt	yeah no probs
2013-11-04 15:48:56	kweaver	yeah definitely dleonhardt
2013-11-04 15:49:28	kweaver	thanks
2013-11-04 15:50:06	kweaver	and box out tommyvyo.  ive spent years cultivating this relationship with dleonhardt.
2013-11-04 15:50:13	kweaver	like an old weathered farmer
2013-11-04 15:50:15	kweaver	tending to his crops
2013-11-04 15:50:31	dleonhardt	exactly ;)
2013-11-04 15:51:02	dleonhardt	almost literally
2013-11-04 15:51:29	dleonhardt	after that photoshoot in the soybean field in front of the tech park i'd say we're pretty much farmers
2013-11-04 15:52:15	kweaver	hahahaha
2013-11-04 15:52:19	kweaver	yeah exactly
2013-11-04 15:52:25	kweaver	did I tell you
2013-11-04 15:52:33	kweaver	I ran into the photographer that did that shoot?
2013-11-04 15:53:21	kweaver	jhartigan:  and I made this site for a company called Ogren Construction http://ogrenconstruction.com
2013-11-04 15:53:31	kweaver	they put me in touch with their photographer
2013-11-04 15:53:41	jhartigan	dudes fuckin cray
2013-11-04 15:53:48	jhartigan	knows what hes doing.. but man oh man is he crazy
2013-11-04 15:54:00	kweaver	yeah hes pretty cray
2013-11-04 15:54:13	kweaver	and when we realized we had already worked together for that photo shoot
2013-11-04 15:54:29	kweaver	the guy was like "yeah that brian guy you were working with..  hes definitely a weird one"
2013-11-04 15:55:09	jhartigan	coming from the same guy who proceeded to call me and state that the pictures our client chose for their website (that they own) had to come down as they werent the best quality
2013-11-04 15:56:02	jchaike_	guys ive got a possibly impossible question. in XCart at work, you can add "validation JS" and the "validation" i added was that this window.open needs to show up, and its a form, and i need to pass BACK to the original window true or false, is that even possible?
2013-11-04 15:56:34	kweaver	haha yeahhhhh so that def tells you something about brian
2013-11-04 15:56:54	kweaver	ive never worked with xcart
2013-11-04 15:56:55	jhartigan	im not even sure what you just said jchaike_
2013-11-04 15:57:00	kweaver	but anything is possible
2013-11-04 15:57:03	kweaver	if you put your heart into it
2013-11-04 15:57:07	jchaike_	lmao
2013-11-04 15:57:08	jhartigan	why not have validation do something way less confusing
2013-11-04 15:57:18	jhartigan	window.open wouldnt show up
2013-11-04 15:57:42	jhartigan	but you could window.open(function () { do something for validation here}; i presume
2013-11-04 15:57:48	jhartigan	so that when that window opens it validates
2013-11-04 15:57:54	jhartigan	but honestly i have no clue what you need
2013-11-04 15:59:03	dleonhardt	kweaver: yeah? that's hilarious
2013-11-04 15:59:16	dleonhardt	kweaver: pretty much cray cray

2013-11-04 16:00:50	kweaver	turned out we spent the afternoon in the same soybean field
2013-11-04 16:00:52	kweaver	and didnt realize it
2013-11-04 16:01:11	jchaike_	it submits a mailto:
2013-11-04 16:01:12	kweaver	well..  until we did actually realize it
2013-11-04 16:01:18	jchaike_	because you know... we're futuristic :)
2013-11-04 16:01:32	jhartigan	then why does it need to return anything
2013-11-04 16:01:42	jchaike_	if it returns true, it will add to the cart
2013-11-04 16:01:47	jchaike_	if it returns false, it wont be added to the cart
2013-11-04 16:02:00	jchaike_	which i wasnt made aware of until after i made this lame popup lol
2013-11-04 16:02:56	jhartigan	so why bother with true and false. if they submit add it to your cart
2013-11-04 16:03:03	jhartigan	also you need scrollbars on that popup
2013-11-04 16:03:48	jchaike_	because i cant intercept that, the second add to cart is hit, it adds to cart,
2013-11-04 16:04:08	jchaike_	im actually maybe just going to make a modal window overlay instead of a popup, but i have to code it all in js so its gonna be a bitch lol
2013-11-04 16:05:31	jhartigan	you can intercept anything you want
2013-11-04 16:05:53	jhartigan	but why not just add the dimensions to the page and require them in order to click add to cart
2013-11-04 16:06:29	jchaike_	because they dont want it to work that way lol
2013-11-04 16:08:46	jhartigan	well then i would just send it from your form
2013-11-04 16:09:01	jchaike_	hm yeah ill have to look into that

2013-11-05 10:57:05	jhartigan	livers are overrated
2013-11-05 11:00:37	jhartigan	so Tab Clear was made by coke, as an unpopular diet type drink, in order to kill Crystal Pepsi, and it totally worked
2013-11-05 11:00:40	jhartigan	thats fuckign awesome
2013-11-05 11:03:24	matthewspeak	crytal pepsi was dope

2013-11-05 11:07:13	jhartigan	never thought about it. tarnish your own shit to create an association
2013-11-05 11:07:23	jhartigan	they marketed tab as a diet / health dirnk
2013-11-05 11:07:35	jhartigan	and sold it as the coke crystal pepsi

2013-11-05 11:45:05	@MpWilli	he did say he was your worst nightmare
2013-11-05 11:46:01	jhartigan	dtriley4: you see there were no injuries in the shooting last night?
2013-11-05 11:46:28	dtriley4	no
2013-11-05 11:46:30	dtriley4	that's good
2013-11-05 11:46:34	dtriley4	jhartigan:
2013-11-05 11:46:41	dtriley4	i only read shots fired
2013-11-05 11:47:22	jhartigan	dude fired shots into the mall scared people then killed himself in footlocker
2013-11-05 11:47:34	beadyox	how is that possible
2013-11-05 11:47:56	beadyox	why would someone do that
2013-11-05 11:48:19	@MpWilli	to commit suicide in a big way
2013-11-05 11:48:24	jhartigan	my only guess now is whoever he was looking for wasnt there
2013-11-05 11:48:28	jhartigan	and they had half a conscience
2013-11-05 11:50:06	beadyox	whatever at least he hurt nobody and still managed to take himself out in the process
2013-11-05 11:50:39	beadyox	good guy would be mass murderer: misses targets, kills himself, avoiding drawn out money wasting trial

2013-11-08 10:36:07	jhartigan	so someone in his chat linked a myfreecams link.  and he was like actually i should remove it instead of condoning you but lets see where this goes.
2013-11-08 10:36:08	matthewspeak	the other day my friend said "here's a picture of when i was younger"
2013-11-08 10:36:19	matthewspeak	i said "every picture of you is of when you were younger"

2013-11-08 10:36:34	jhartigan	so she asked them what happened and they linked his stream

2013-11-08 10:37:14	jhartigan	so they said they wanted to thank him
2013-11-08 10:37:24	jhartigan	he was like fine have her skype me and desrow
2013-11-08 10:37:34	jhartigan	she couldnt figure it out. he gets a troll call first
2013-11-08 10:37:56	jhartigan	then desrow and chat convinced him to send her a skype.. and he was like troll interviewing her and shit.. was aboslutely hilarious
2013-11-08 10:37:59	jhartigan	but THEN
2013-11-08 10:38:38	jhartigan	she got enough tips for her "cum show" so shes like "alright guys i gotta do a cum show i gotta stop talking for a bit.. but uh did you wanna stay on the call"

2013-11-08 15:35:20	jchaike	well then, i might need to get some wordpress crash course books lol
2013-11-08 15:39:36	@MpWilli	you dont need a book to tell you that wordpress is dumb shit
2013-11-08 15:39:47	@MpWilli	also its pretty easy to use
2013-11-08 15:41:30	jharty	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2013-11-08 15:42:24	@MpWilli	thanks jharty always got my back
2013-11-08 15:42:45	jchaike	MpWilli, i mean i know how to use wordpress, thats the easy part
2013-11-08 15:42:56	jchaike	i feel like creating a wordpress site from scratch without a previous template/theme is difficult
2013-11-08 15:42:59	jchaike	*more difficult
2013-11-08 15:43:13	jhartigan	sub themes
2013-11-08 15:44:21	@MpWilli	yeah jchaike theme development from scratch takes a lot of time.
2013-11-08 15:44:30	@MpWilli	i work with wp every day and have never done that
2013-11-08 15:44:40	@MpWilli	like jhartigan said sub themes work wonders
2013-11-08 15:44:59	jchaike	oh so then wordpress isnt really as "complex" as i thought it was
2013-11-08 15:45:20	jchaike	sub themes, meaning you take an existing theme that has things you like about it, and manipulate it?
2013-11-08 15:45:42	@MpWilli	like if you wanted to. you coul take the twenty thirteen theme. make a child theme. and customize literally everything
2013-11-08 15:45:49	@MpWilli	sub themes= child themes
2013-11-08 15:46:07	@MpWilli	they are connected to a parent them.
2013-11-08 15:47:05	@MpWilli	jchaike http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes
2013-11-08 15:47:16	@MpWilli	also dont buy a book. wordpress is very well documented
2013-11-08 15:47:19	jhartigan	and that parent touches them
2013-11-08 15:47:31	jhartigan	its very well documented, poorly designed but its all there
2013-11-08 15:47:41	@MpWilli	yeah
2013-11-08 15:47:54	jchaike	awesome, thanks guys
2013-11-08 15:47:59	jchaike	&& yeah i was exaggerating about the book
2013-11-08 15:48:05	@MpWilli	haha okay

2013-11-08 15:48:19	@MpWilli	but yeah you can do a lot of stuff with child themes.
2013-11-08 15:48:32	@MpWilli	ive made an entire site based entirely on windgets
2013-11-08 15:49:20	jhartigan	yeah wordpress works well for less complicated things and smaller domains
2013-11-08 15:49:27	@MpWilli	the main problem lies in other peoples themes. People write the sloppiest grossest code
2013-11-08 15:49:36	jhartigan	DO NOT USE ELEGANT THEMES
2013-11-08 15:49:41	@MpWilli	god damn so bad!

2013-11-08 15:49:47	@MpWilli	seriously
2013-11-08 15:50:07	jhartigan	ET are undocumented and will say it looks great from their house in cambodia in IE8
2013-11-08 15:50:08	@MpWilli	even then hahaha. im working on this theme and it was reading my child theme styles
2013-11-08 15:50:12	@MpWilli	even though they were loading

2013-11-12 10:22:28	jhartigan	whats it say?
2013-11-12 10:22:34	kweaver	A hyper transport sync floor error occurred on last boot.
2013-11-12 10:22:42	kweaver	people are saying it could be a number of things
2013-11-12 10:22:57	kweaver	most of the time people that get it just updated their bios, and changed some hardware
2013-11-12 10:23:00	kweaver	i havent dont anything
2013-11-12 10:23:03	kweaver	done**
2013-11-12 10:23:38	kweaver	new ram is the newest thing, but that was like a month ago
2013-11-12 10:23:53	jhartigan	did you set your ram timings
2013-11-12 10:24:04	jhartigan	cause most mobos dont set them properly
2013-11-12 10:24:23	kweaver	running a memory test now
2013-11-12 10:24:36	kweaver	everything worked when I installed my new ram, so I didnt touch anything
2013-11-12 10:25:21	jhartigan	memtest shouldnt show problems with ram timings, but i wonder if its over/undervolted and you had some kind of power issue
2013-11-12 10:25:24	jhartigan	also what mobo again?
2013-11-12 10:25:57	jhartigan	If you find the HT sync flood error reoccurs, check the BIOS for settings related to high precision event timers (HPET), and disable the feature
2013-11-12 10:26:10	jhartigan	lso, check the motherboard maker's site for a BIOS update documented to address the problem.

2013-11-13 09:32:13	kweaver_laptop	Jimmi Williams just posted this on FB:
2013-11-13 09:32:15	kweaver_laptop	"I'm Jimi. Nineteen years old and honestly loving life more than ever. I'm in college, I have a job, and a wonderful girlfriend. There's only one downside to all of these amazing things in my life, I just recently found out that I suffer from lung cancer. I know, I know. How does someone get lung cancer at such a young age? Heck if I know. But what I do know is that growing up I've learned to stay strong.
2013-11-13 09:32:15	kweaver_laptop	I've learned that no matter what life throws at you, to always keep your chin up and stay smiling. Because in the end, it will all work out the way it's supposed to. Fuck what doctors say, my time on this Earth will be as long as I want it to be. And for all of you genuinely nice people who are getting bashed on because of how you look, fuck the haters too! You are who you are, and you should never change
2013-11-13 09:32:15	kweaver_laptop	for anybody. Don't let anyone or anything ever bring you down. You can't control everything in your life, but what you can control is your positive attitude. Stay smiling, be happy, and live life to the fullest."

2013-11-14 10:48:31	jhartigan	its basically necessity
2013-11-14 10:48:55	kweaver	I think thats probably true about certain candies and cereals

2013-11-14 10:49:02	kweaver	lol
2013-11-14 10:49:28	jhartigan	but a commercial isnt going to make you any more aware or inclined to buy one
2013-11-14 10:49:35	jhartigan	candies and cereals i forget about

2013-11-14 15:44:14	dtriley4	i've wanted to try angular
2013-11-14 15:44:32	dtriley4	i wrote ember off because at the time of my interest they didn't back native backend support or w/e

2013-11-14 15:46:06	dtriley4	i've got to write a cool enough backend to justify using it
2013-11-14 15:46:27	dtriley4	or i could make a list of all my friends and put it in a .txt file and just use it as a seed file

2013-11-15 09:47:02	kweaver	im not too worried though
2013-11-15 09:47:22	kweaver	just people complaining that google wallet isnt popular enough yet
2013-11-15 09:47:30	_thomas	lol
2013-11-15 09:47:42	_thomas	hahahahahaha
2013-11-15 09:47:48	jhartigan	two major points: they are a) breaking the law, by taking your money before delivering a product, at least in the US as all major cards require proof of shipment before charging, b) its completely uncommon to charge for your production before youve got it set up
2013-11-15 09:47:59	jhartigan	the other one is that they are moving in the wrong direction and its true
2013-11-15 09:48:09	jhartigan	digital wallets are way more important than an all in one card
2013-11-15 09:48:17	kweaver	but I already have one of those
2013-11-15 09:48:20	kweaver	lol

2013-11-15 09:48:43	jhartigan	right
2013-11-15 09:48:45	kweaver	and its kind of hard to hand ryan my phone and ask him to bump it into the register
2013-11-15 09:48:49	kweaver	so until then
2013-11-15 09:48:56	_thomas	the other is that solar flares could potentially destroy your digital financial history and the number of points in the stock market will be cut by twice your birthday from your cousins side twice removed and skittles will rain from the sky and we'll all be stuck reading about it on Yahoo! News
2013-11-15 09:48:58	kweaver	im cool with having 1 card and some cash
2013-11-15 09:49:00	jhartigan	right, but the card makes tha t process take longer

2013-11-15 09:59:38	jchaike	So everyone needs to switch to XCart, it uses the latest and greatest web browser technology, theres this new browser called NN6 I heard its great, its only about 10 years outdated so nbd
2013-11-15 09:59:41	jchaike	"Use IE5 or later / NN6 or later to work in Webmaster mode."
2013-11-15 10:01:08	ericmazzola	i can't find anything about NN6 in my altavista seraches
2013-11-15 10:01:08	ericmazzola	:(
2013-11-15 10:01:18	kweaver	lololol
2013-11-15 10:01:22	jchaike	dude ericmazzola you gotta use dogpile!
2013-11-15 10:01:22	kweaver	thats a shame jchaike
2013-11-15 10:01:30	kweaver	is that for a client where you work?
2013-11-15 10:01:33	ericmazzola	TIL altavista was bought by yahoo in 2003
2013-11-15 10:01:39	jhartigan	damn yo.. i didnt even know netscape navigator got to fucking 6
2013-11-15 10:01:49	jhartigan	firefox is a great browser/successor
2013-11-15 10:02:12	ericmazzola	idunno man

2013-11-15 10:02:23	jchaike	kweaver, thats for where i work, lol im trying to figure out their mess of variables and XCart has this cool webmaster mode that might have helped... if it was 2002 lol
2013-11-15 10:02:32	jchaike	ericmazzola, i hate firefox
2013-11-15 10:02:32	jhartigan	i use firefox daily
2013-11-15 10:02:32	ericmazzola	it takes SOOOO long to start
2013-11-15 10:02:33	ericmazzola	firebug is nice
2013-11-15 10:02:38	jhartigan	chromes gotten too slow and bloated
2013-11-15 10:02:42	ericmazzola	but that is literally the only reason why I use firefox
2013-11-15 10:02:48	kweaver	but I mean, does your company actually use it?
2013-11-15 10:02:53	kweaver	or a client of your company?
2013-11-15 10:02:54	ericmazzola	chrome is way faster than firefox?

2013-11-20 10:18:54	kweaver1	MpWilli do you and tom have any sort of centrallized access to your resource files?  all of your client stuff and images and psds?
2013-11-20 10:19:19	kweaver1	if not, you should look into bit torrent sync

2013-11-20 10:19:42	kweaver1	so theres no limit
2013-11-20 10:19:52	kweaver1	you just set whichever folder to be a sync folder
2013-11-20 10:20:03	@MpWilli	nah ive generally just been putting psd's and assets in our repos when they are needed
2013-11-20 10:20:12	@MpWilli	but obviously that can have it downfalls
2013-11-20 10:21:20	kweaver1	ah ok
2013-11-20 10:21:27	kweaver1	yeah ive been pretty happy with this
2013-11-20 10:21:53	kweaver1	if you did decide to use it also, we could make a shared folder
2013-11-20 10:22:11	kweaver1	which would make transfering these gigs of video a lot easier
2013-11-20 10:22:18	@MpWilli	yeah at this point in the game we havent had much need for such an outlet. but im sure itll come time soon
2013-11-20 10:22:58	kweaver1	now that I think about it, im not even sure how I would have given you guys access
2013-11-20 10:23:14	kweaver1	because this folder is going to be pretty massive

2013-11-20 14:13:54	@MpWilli	yeah jchaike. its a good idea i guess in theory but its literally years out until you can safely use it
2013-11-20 14:15:53	jhartigan	there were two articles on it. it was more editorial rather than on a site, but good points but i dont know them off hand ericmazzola and i dont have my laptop anymre to look it up
2013-11-20 14:16:07	ericmazzola	gotcha
2013-11-20 14:16:08	ericmazzola	no worries
2013-11-20 14:16:39	jhartigan	i can summarize them if you want ericmazzola 
2013-11-20 14:17:00	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-11-20 14:17:03	ericmazzola	briefly paraphrase
2013-11-20 14:18:50	jhartigan	1) (Not really a product issue) They are violating us card laws by charging you before proof of shipment for a product.  All major us cards protect their uses by requiring proof of shipment in order to place a charge.  They are basically kickstarting without a kickstarter.  Could be an honest mistke, but kickstarter is valid because you are paying for a service, not a product - here you pay for a product
2013-11-20 14:18:50	jhartigan	that you will not see for at least6months
2013-11-20 14:20:07	jhartigan	2) It is preventing the real and necessary revolution to services like google wallet.  Sure it sounds good to have all your cards in one spot, its great really, but it gives retailers and card vendors reasons not to switch and make hardware and software for digital services
2013-11-20 14:22:47	jhartigan	3) Its a completely invalid credit card.  In order for merchants to actually help fight a fruad case, and therefore have insurance coverage for the costs to do so, they are required to take a mold physically.  In 90% of cases this isnt a major issue, as video surveilance also suffices, but as many people pointed out - many places like with rental services and anything done overseas require molds.  This
2013-11-20 14:22:47	jhartigan	also applies to th new flat cards without raised lettering and numbers so there is talk of change on this point.
2013-11-20 14:25:05	ericmazzola	yeah
2013-11-20 14:25:31	jhartigan	4) The software/hardware itself - the same technology could be developed with a current style card and use online authentication for your accounts - presenting you with a choice on the screen or for the cashier
2013-11-20 14:26:17	jhartigan	this reduces cost to the consumer, is just as vulnerable/invulnerable as todays services, and could centralize receipts
2013-11-20 14:26:24	jhartigan	those are the major ones i remember ericmazzola 
2013-11-20 14:26:50	ericmazzola	tahnks
2013-11-20 14:29:06	jhartigan	yeah. it made me realize that its still a great concept, but executed poorly and is definitely impeding virtual wallet type services

2013-11-22 15:32:47	ericmazzola	and one of Ben's friends really wanted to make a beer too, and said he wanted to start with a brown
2013-11-22 15:32:57	ericmazzola	so I'm just basically showing them how to brew
2013-11-22 15:33:12	ericmazzola	they paid for the mats
2013-11-22 15:33:16	kweaver1	nice
2013-11-22 15:33:42	ericmazzola	my pumpkin beer came out meh at first
2013-11-22 15:33:52	ericmazzola	but i just tried one a few days ago
2013-11-22 15:33:56	ericmazzola	and it was outstanding
2013-11-22 15:34:10	ericmazzola	it got SOOOOO much better with age
2013-11-22 15:34:31	ericmazzola	so in the future - if you guys make a pumpkin beer - def let it age
2013-11-22 15:34:49	ericmazzola	this only really applies if you use actual pumpkin in it
2013-11-22 15:35:48	matthewspeak	you call your beer fullbeerd?
2013-11-22 15:38:04	ericmazzola	im really angry
2013-11-22 15:38:10	ericmazzola	because now i really want a witty name
2013-11-22 15:38:21	ericmazzola	but nothing comes close to how clutch fullbeerd is

2013-11-25 10:17:53	kweaver	I went through the exact same progression though.  thought minecraft looked like it was for role players and time wasters, so I tried out terraria for a bit and really liked the concept.  but I started getting bored with it pretty quickly

2013-12-05 14:37:34	jakesan	yeah burg has a dependency error thats super easy to fix.. but his comments are all in chinese and i didnt feel like searching the source code to fix it

2013-12-05 14:38:59	bananaboy_deskto	burg bios bzr
2013-12-05 14:41:35	jakesan	yeah
2013-12-05 14:41:40	jakesan	its a new bug
2013-12-05 14:41:46	jakesan	because of a change in the freetype libraries
2013-12-05 14:42:10	jakesan	one if the included c files is no longer freetype/library its just librar but i dont feel like finding it in the source
2013-12-05 14:42:13	bananaboy_deskto	ah, this guy adopts the package, its already bzr and says i dont feel like downloading it
2013-12-05 14:42:17	bananaboy_deskto	so its not bzr anymore...
2013-12-05 14:42:22	jakesan	he just moved it to git
2013-12-05 14:42:50	bananaboy_deskto	he should abandon that one, and start a new one, burg-git

2013-12-05 14:43:45	jakesan	no one adopted the EFI so i think burg might die

2013-12-06 15:25:04	matthewspeak	i dropped your names this morning so hopefully he doesn't know you by name
2013-12-06 15:25:39	jhartigan	i mean i planned on apologizing for yelling to him as it wasnt his fault and i was just pissed at the overall situation
2013-12-06 15:25:49	jhartigan	according to kweaver no one there cared but who knows
2013-12-06 15:25:50	matthewspeak	might be a good idea
2013-12-06 15:26:04	kweaver	on the plus side, chef mark has introduced jake and jeff as business partners a couple times
2013-12-06 15:26:12	matthewspeak	as long as he doesn't find out that you killed that one guy
2013-12-06 15:26:13	jhartigan	yeah. like 5
2013-12-06 15:26:40	kweaver	yeah I havent seen john since, but mark and ryan didnt care
2013-12-06 15:27:00	kweaver	I dont think john even knew what happeend
2013-12-06 15:27:14	kweaver	and tommyvyo_ how is nemours bmi broken?
2013-12-06 15:28:01	jhartigan	yeah i just planned on apologizing cause he really didnt do anything to get yelled at for. but i was drunk, and pissed and i knew he owned the place
2013-12-06 15:28:17	jhartigan	you put those facts in a tank together and yelling seems like a great option
2013-12-06 15:31:12	t_mmyv	hahahaha wait
2013-12-06 15:31:16	t_mmyv	can we talk about why
2013-12-06 15:31:17	t_mmyv	things went down
2013-12-06 15:31:19	t_mmyv	like
2013-12-06 15:31:24	t_mmyv	"he called my mom ugly"
2013-12-06 15:31:30	t_mmyv	or "he spilled beer on my new shoes"
2013-12-06 15:31:33	t_mmyv	like.... da fuq?
2013-12-06 15:32:20	t_mmyv	specifically the "calculating BMI" part
2013-12-06 15:32:22	t_mmyv	kweaver
2013-12-06 15:33:01	t_mmyv	nvm
2013-12-06 15:33:29	matthewspeak	jake almost got into a fight with a guy that was too protective of his space
2013-12-06 15:33:57	matthewspeak	the entourages had to separate them and then we left
2013-12-06 15:34:55	matthewspeak	jake was probably just bumping into the guy because he was drunk but the guy was way too aggressive about it
2013-12-06 15:36:56	kweaver	matthewspeak, turned out jake squeezed in between the dude and his wife without realizing
2013-12-06 15:37:12	jhartigan	i still dont understand that
2013-12-06 15:37:15	kweaver	and jake, thinking he was just at a legit spot at the bar, just chilled waiting for a bar tender
2013-12-06 15:37:17	jhartigan	the girl on the left of the dude was saying shit
2013-12-06 15:37:29	jhartigan	regardless, say that instead of elbowing me
2013-12-06 15:37:34	jhartigan	and telling me i need to move
2013-12-06 15:37:37	jhartigan	cause you do that
2013-12-06 15:37:41	jhartigan	im gonna stand my ground
2013-12-06 15:37:45	jhartigan	and look. we had an issue
2013-12-06 15:41:27	matthewspeak	oh shit
2013-12-06 15:42:39	kweaver	jhartigan was the dude black?
2013-12-06 15:43:20	kweaver	I thought I had an idea of who it was, and then ryan said he was some 6 ft tall black christan basketball player
2013-12-06 15:43:36	jhartigan	what
2013-12-06 15:43:37	kweaver	and that was not the vision of the person i thought it was
2013-12-06 15:43:40	jhartigan	no
2013-12-06 15:43:43	jhartigan	wait what
2013-12-06 15:43:46	jhartigan	he was white
2013-12-06 15:43:52	kweaver	oh seriously?
2013-12-06 15:43:54	jhartigan	im so confused now
2013-12-06 15:43:59	kweaver	dude maybe ryan has it wrong
2013-12-06 15:44:11	jhartigan	i mean i was drunk, but i dont confuse black and white
2013-12-06 15:44:16	jhartigan	and i didnt think the dude was 6ft tall
2013-12-06 15:44:26	jhartigan	id say lets ask jeff, but he thought it was carls friend
2013-12-06 15:44:28	jhartigan	so hes out
2013-12-06 15:44:33	kweaver	lolol
2013-12-06 15:44:59	jhartigan	wait.. for real? he said it was a big black guy?
2013-12-06 15:44:59	kweaver	maybe the guy ryan thought it was, was just there holding people back?
2013-12-06 15:45:05	jhartigan	possible yeah
2013-12-06 15:45:13	jhartigan	and maybe i did get between him and his wife
2013-12-06 15:45:27	jhartigan	and maybe it was the girl to the left of the douchebag who started shit was saying shit
2013-12-06 15:45:31	jhartigan	she was white right kweaver?
2013-12-06 15:45:34	kweaver	yeah
2013-12-06 15:46:00	jhartigan	so unless the big black guy has a white girlfriend... totally possible - not being racist -- just going with likely options in gboro
2013-12-06 15:46:06	jhartigan	i think theres some confusion
2013-12-06 15:47:33	jhartigan	maybe the seat i got in front of was johhny basketballs.. and thats why ryan thought it went that way
2013-12-06 15:48:02	jhartigan	have to reboot brb

2013-12-08 16:55:35	kweaver	MpWilli: mpwilli_sexy tommyvyo_ pull and check out the seeds file
2013-12-08 16:56:27	kweaver	I added initial seeds for our companies and admin users, and then a rake task "populate" to throw in tons of example data
2013-12-08 16:58:14	kweaver	so if you just do "rake db:seed", youll get just our companies (and eventually other legit data), and if you run "rake db:populate" after that, you'll get 10 example billing organizations with 30 example clients
2013-12-08 16:58:43	kweaver	in each billing company
2013-12-08 16:59:01	@MpWilli	woordd
2013-12-08 16:59:50	kweaver	that way we can check and style for pagination and just have more data to work with
2013-12-08 17:03:29	@MpWilli	cool cool
2013-12-08 17:04:09	kweaver	but then if youre like "fuck all this example data", just run "rake db:reset" and youre back to just us

2013-12-08 17:04:47	@MpWilli	what did you never go to sleep
2013-12-08 17:05:37	kweaver	I slept for 2 hours
2013-12-08 17:05:41	kweaver	but my brian was just going
2013-12-08 17:08:26	@MpWilli	damn thats brutal
2013-12-08 17:08:42	kweaver	nah, I just grabbed coffee and kept going
2013-12-08 17:08:46	kweaver	gonna do static pages

2013-12-08 17:09:07	kweaver	and then that way if you get bored, you can start thinking about the front end website

2013-12-08 17:13:47	t_mmyv	ayo MpWilli
2013-12-08 17:13:58	t_mmyv	you should pick some fontelloz out
2013-12-08 17:17:34	kweaver	agreeze
2013-12-08 17:18:10	kweaver	t_mmyv I was thinking about refactor Organization to Client
2013-12-08 17:18:14	kweaver	whatdya think?
2013-12-08 17:18:21	t_mmyv	give me one good reason
2013-12-08 17:19:11	kweaver	because having BillingOrganization and Organization seems needlessly confusing, and we've already adopted the term "client" on the frontend
2013-12-08 17:19:13	kweaver	theres 2
2013-12-08 17:19:46	kweaver	if I were to just look at the model names, I would assume BillingOrganization would be a subset of Organization
2013-12-08 17:20:00	t_mmyv	it is
2013-12-08 17:20:27	kweaver	what i mean is that I wouldnt assume an BillingOrganization has many Organizations
2013-12-08 17:20:44	kweaver	it would make more sense to say that a BillingOrganization has many Clients
2013-12-08 17:20:59	kweaver	i dunno thats just me
2013-12-08 17:21:04	kweaver	its up to your either way
2013-12-08 17:21:09	kweaver	just throwing it out dere
2013-12-08 17:21:15	t_mmyv	i disagree
2013-12-08 17:21:27	t_mmyv	a billing organization is a business
2013-12-08 17:21:30	t_mmyv	an organization is a business
2013-12-08 17:21:55	kweaver	if anything I would so do something like BillingOrganization and ClientOrganization
2013-12-08 17:21:56	t_mmyv	at NCST right now i'm working with the director of IT to do 508 compliance
2013-12-08 17:22:12	t_mmyv	and i'm also working with the VP of marketing to do webdesign stuffs
2013-12-08 17:22:51	t_mmyv	seems redundant to me to have two records pointing to the same physical organization, merely because i'm working with multiple deparmtents
2013-12-08 17:23:24	t_mmyv	in the context of the app it makes sense though
2013-12-08 17:23:37	t_mmyv	its two organizations communicating, with one organization billing the other
2013-12-08 17:24:11	t_mmyv	<kweaver>	 what i mean is that I wouldnt assume an BillingOrganization has many Organizations
2013-12-08 17:24:52	t_mmyv	^ there is no place for assumptions when ya can read the two different classes source directly :O
2013-12-08 17:25:07	t_mmyv	in my opinion :O
2013-12-08 17:25:21	kweaver	ideally it should be normalized out to combine all duplicate fields to one parent class
2013-12-08 17:25:23	kweaver	Organization
2013-12-08 17:25:28	kweaver	with two children classes
2013-12-08 17:25:31	kweaver	BillingOrganization
2013-12-08 17:25:37	kweaver	and ClientOrganization
2013-12-08 17:25:40	t_mmyv	it was like that
2013-12-08 17:25:48	t_mmyv	and then a billing organization got a billing provider
2013-12-08 17:25:54	t_mmyv	and 3 email templates
2013-12-08 17:26:21	kweaver	thats fine though
2013-12-08 17:26:42	t_mmyv	thats my technical answer to the original question
2013-12-08 17:26:48	t_mmyv	my real answer however
2013-12-08 17:26:50	t_mmyv	is if you want to, do it
2013-12-08 17:26:53	kweaver	lol
2013-12-08 17:26:55	kweaver	im not that picky
2013-12-08 17:26:56	t_mmyv	but be aware that you're going to be rewriting every form
2013-12-08 17:26:57	t_mmyv	every path
2013-12-08 17:26:59	kweaver	i just wanted to pick your brain
2013-12-08 17:27:14	t_mmyv	named routes are a bitch to refactor
2013-12-08 17:27:43	t_mmyv	whattup toh
2013-12-08 17:27:44	t_mmyv	tho
2013-12-08 17:27:51	t_mmyv	im just startin to work on it
2013-12-08 17:28:07	kweaver	ah
2013-12-08 17:28:15	kweaver	you see what I said about the rake task I made?
2013-12-08 17:28:23	t_mmyv	no
2013-12-08 17:28:40	t_mmyv	where
2013-12-08 17:28:51	kweaver	I added initial seeds for our companies and admin users, and then a rake task "populate" to throw in tons of example data
2013-12-08 17:29:02	kweaver	so if you just do "rake db:seed", youll get just our companies (and eventually other legit data), and if you run "rake db:populate" after that, you'll get 10 example billing organizations with 30 example clients

2013-12-08 17:30:48	kweaver	so just pull and check seeds and /lib/tasks/sample_data.rake
2013-12-08 17:30:58	t_mmyv	word
2013-12-08 17:31:48	t_mmyv	whats next 4u

2013-12-08 19:35:28	kweaver	look at the environment as well
2013-12-08 19:35:57	kweaver	err
2013-12-08 19:36:00	kweaver	the current market
2013-12-08 19:36:13	kweaver	of similar, barebones style billing apps
2013-12-08 19:37:23	kweaver	because as excited as itd be to see it get huge, and attract attention, it would almost seem wasteful to attract a bunch of attention to ourself without any other sort of SASS app to take advantage of the spotlight 
2013-12-08 19:38:10	kweaver	I kind of always imagined putting at least one small sass app before puting out some open source work to soak in the sun and attract attention
2013-12-08 19:43:14	t_mmyv	kweaver there are a million online billing apps betetr than ours
2013-12-08 19:43:21	t_mmyv	it would make more sense to open sourcei t and offer a hosted oslution
2013-12-08 19:47:21	kweaver	thats what I thought too, but actually looking around, the ones out there are reallly expensive, and I really havent found any that allow you to create client logins
2013-12-08 19:48:02	kweaver	and quickbooks exporting is a complete ghost, because everyone is pretending they can compete with QB
2013-12-08 19:48:26	kweaver	well we'll all have to sleep on it and think it over more
2013-12-08 19:50:13	kweaver	Im not opposed to the idea by any means.  it crossed my mind when I was putting together the wireframes
2013-12-08 19:51:09	kweaver	we just need to go through all of the direct alternatives, go over what they offer, and what they cost
2013-12-08 19:53:10	kweaver	open sourcing and offering a hosted alternative is a good idea though
2013-12-08 19:54:44	kweaver	because it combines the hacker news and reddit spotlight of "Hey I just released a free full working app with little direct alternatives", and the ability to still make some profit from the hosted version for the lazy and non-techie peeps
2013-12-08 19:55:44	kweaver	emphasis on "direct" alternatives,  there are plenty of similar alternatives
2013-12-08 20:12:53	kweaver	tommyvyo_: t_mmyv well I only ended up sleeping like 2 hours this morning so ima call it early 
2013-12-08 20:13:14	kweaver	lets G+ a couple nights this week so this shit dont fall off our radar
2013-12-08 20:13:46	kweaver	like I said, it cant be my #1 priority until next week, but I still wanna keep our momentum going
2013-12-08 20:13:58	kweaver	mpwilli_sexy:  you too boo
2013-12-08 20:16:28	kweaver	my motivation feels refreshed from this weekend.  honestly, I think we could have a very rough mvp with some night time work and another hacker marathon.
2013-12-08 20:17:22	kweaver	I think the key to our sucess with this one is just keeping the MVP completely in our sites and not budging to add additional funcationality or refactoring until that is done
2013-12-08 20:18:07	kweaver	sights**

2013-12-09 11:49:44	kweaver	that sounds like a good idea for practice, but I wonder if its worth the extra steps for both of us so early on in the app?
2013-12-09 11:51:25	kweaver	I did push a few broken things while we were workin on it this weekend, but thats mostly because we were kinda rushing
2013-12-09 11:51:52	kweaver	working on it from now on, I can assure you that I will check myself before wrecking myself
2013-12-09 11:52:32	kweaver	and in terms of ownership, I really dont care who the owner is if we ever put it on github

2013-12-09 11:54:36	@MpWilli	jakenbake ive an idea. ill get a piece of wood and drill holes in it for you
2013-12-09 11:54:38	t_mmyvyo	lol
2013-12-09 11:54:46	@MpWilli	and then glue my mouse pad to it
2013-12-09 11:54:47	jakenbake	okay
2013-12-09 11:54:50	jakenbake	i could totally make one
2013-12-09 11:54:52	jakenbake	but im lazy
2013-12-09 11:54:54	jakenbake	but im also poor
2013-12-09 11:54:59	jakenbake	so i think i will make one
2013-12-09 11:55:26	@MpWilli	thats the easiest designed product ive ever seen
2013-12-09 11:55:30	jakenbake	yep
2013-12-09 11:55:37	jakenbake	good on them though MpWilli
2013-12-09 11:55:39	jakenbake	its pretty pimp
2013-12-09 11:55:50	jakenbake	but i do think ill make that a post paycheck project
2013-12-09 11:55:57	kweaver	plus t_mmyvyo, I made you admin on the repo too
2013-12-09 11:56:02	jakenbake	really simple with drill router and sheet of wood
2013-12-09 11:56:10	@MpWilli	yeah absolutely
2013-12-09 11:56:23	jakenbake	hardest part would be sanding and cutting the mousepad slot
2013-12-09 11:56:24	@MpWilli	it would probably be fun to make one too
2013-12-09 11:56:31	jakenbake	yeah def
2013-12-09 11:56:35	jakenbake	i halfway built a desk once
2013-12-09 11:56:44	@MpWilli	yeah sanding is always a bitch
2013-12-09 11:56:51	@MpWilli	i fully built a desk once
2013-12-09 11:56:54	jakenbake	then my basement flooded and my desk in progress took the cleanup job
2013-12-09 11:56:55	@MpWilli	its fucking hige
2013-12-09 11:56:57	@MpWilli	huge

2013-12-09 12:01:29	kweaver	I dunno, I think it just adds some fluff to a still very small project
2013-12-09 12:02:33	t_mmyvyo	have you ever submitted a pull request?
2013-12-09 12:02:53	t_mmyvyo	i dont see any fluff in adding accountability and discussion to numerous commits
2013-12-09 12:03:04	kweaver	yeah for a BC project, but that was a bigger project with like 8 devs
2013-12-09 12:03:06	t_mmyvyo	say for example you submit a pull req for 7 commits

2013-12-09 12:04:06	t_mmyvyo	plus it makes sure commits and pushes count
2013-12-09 12:04:20	kweaver	ALRIGHTTTTT
2013-12-09 12:04:33	t_mmyvyo	i'd rather have 1 meaningful push with 30 commits over 30 little pushes and 30 commits any day
2013-12-09 12:05:03	kweaver	yeah, but I think that was mostly the case this weekend because we were rushing and all working at the same time
2013-12-09 12:05:52	t_mmyvyo	and that worked because we were all in a centralized location where we could easily communicate what, why, and when were pushing code

2013-12-09 12:06:11	kweaver	ill send pull requests

2013-12-09 12:38:52	kweaver	theres an algorithm that adds and subtracts votes to prevent bullshit and remove some volatility beadyox 
2013-12-09 12:39:03	beadyox	i mean
2013-12-09 12:39:11	beadyox	like the post i submitted
2013-12-09 12:39:15	beadyox	80% like it
2013-12-09 12:39:21	beadyox	but they always lose steam
2013-12-09 12:39:24	beadyox	know what i mean?
2013-12-09 12:39:32	jakenbake	reddit algo
2013-12-09 12:39:38	jakenbake	its more simple and complex than youd think
2013-12-09 12:39:40	beadyox	it seems to take a miracle to get something to the front page
2013-12-09 12:39:51	jakenbake	even if people like it, if it doesnt continually gain traction
2013-12-09 12:39:53	jakenbake	it goes down
2013-12-09 12:39:57	beadyox	you're more paradoxical than you'd think ;)
2013-12-09 12:40:09	jakenbake	popularity/time is just as important as approval rate
2013-12-09 12:40:15	beadyox	http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1sh29t/whenever_i_come_home_from_te_super_market_and/
2013-12-09 12:40:18	[url]:	http://tinyurl.com/qerwacr
2013-12-09 12:40:18	jakenbake	controversial shit also goes up to the front
2013-12-09 12:40:18	beadyox	;)
2013-12-09 12:40:21	jakenbake	so long as its not negative
2013-12-09 12:40:22	kweaver	beadyox, its partially the alogrithm, and partially the fact that millions of people are posting on this site
2013-12-09 12:40:27	kweaver	so your shit is going to get burried
2013-12-09 12:40:48	matthewspeak	depends on the subreddit though right?
2013-12-09 12:41:13	kweaver	yeah exactly
2013-12-09 12:41:21	kweaver	so if youre posting to a subreddit with 200 people
2013-12-09 12:41:31	kweaver	youll probably start right on the front page of that subreddit
2013-12-09 12:41:44	kweaver	and with a couple upvotes, become #1 of that subreddit for a few hours
2013-12-09 12:42:32	kweaver	but if youre trying to post to /r/funny, youll start at like the 15th page of the subreddit, and you wont move up the queue without a lotttt of a quick upvotes
2013-12-09 12:44:05	kweaver	also beadyox, keep in mind that the concept of "the front page of reddit" is an amorphous one because your front page is completely different from everyone elses
2013-12-09 12:46:23	beadyox	yeah yeah
2013-12-09 12:46:33	beadyox	i mean the front page of popular subreddits kweaver
2013-12-09 12:47:30	beadyox	how on earth do people get 1m karma
2013-12-09 12:47:33	beadyox	thats insane
2013-12-09 12:48:15	beadyox	they should have a page that gives you a ranking of people with the top link karma, comment karma, and combined karma
2013-12-09 12:48:17	jakenbake	ebay
2013-12-09 12:48:18	beadyox	or maybe not
2013-12-09 12:48:19	beadyox	hahah
2013-12-09 12:48:39	kweaver	because just like money, it takes karma to make karma
2013-12-09 12:49:15	beadyox	true that
2013-12-09 12:49:23	kweaver	so if I have 1M link karma, and you have 0 link and we both post to /r/funny, my post will probably start at the bottom of the front page there
2013-12-09 12:49:25	kweaver	and yours wont
2013-12-09 12:49:33	kweaver	because reddit trusts that I post good shit
2013-12-09 12:49:35	kweaver	and you dont
2013-12-09 12:49:38	beadyox	yeah well
2013-12-09 12:49:44	beadyox	they remember weird names with all caps
2013-12-09 12:49:50	beadyox	they say
2013-12-09 12:50:10	beadyox	HEY LOOK ITS POTATO IN MY ANUS HAHAHAH THAT GUY IS SO FUCKING FUNNY IM NOT EVEN GOING TO LOOK AT HIS CONTENT BEFORE UPVOTING
