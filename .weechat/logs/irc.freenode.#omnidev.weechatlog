2013-09-12 11:51:28	kweaver_laptop	what do you think we should say to bruiz about the timeframe
2013-09-12 11:52:57	kweaver_laptop	whenever we go a couple weeks without working on heroes, I feel like we are months away from even a basic form submission. but once we work on it for a couple weeks in a row and make progress, I feel like if we wanted to, we could bang it out by the end of the month
2013-09-12 11:53:56	kweaver_laptop	everything else seems to be slowing down, so I think ill start some heroes at night again

2013-09-12 12:28:29	jhartigan	haha okay. just got worried for you
2013-09-12 12:28:31	kweaver_laptop	about working on heroes
2013-09-12 12:28:36	kweaver_laptop	did it go through?
2013-09-12 12:28:41	jhartigan	no you did not
2013-09-12 12:28:51	kweaver_laptop	might not have been on the internet yet then
2013-09-12 12:29:57	kweaver_laptop	I just asked what we wanted to say in our response to brian about where we think the program is
2013-09-12 12:30:35	kweaver_laptop	and then I was saying how whenever we work on it for a couple weeks in a row, I feel like we could totes get something basic done by the end of the month
2013-09-12 12:31:02	kweaver_laptop	but whatever we go a couple weeks without, I feel like itll be months before anything
2013-09-12 12:31:05	kweaver_laptop	whenever***
2013-09-12 12:31:07	jhartigan	well as usual
2013-09-12 12:31:10	jhartigan	brian doesnt listen
2013-09-12 12:31:24	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants a recap 
2013-09-12 12:31:31	kweaver_laptop	to make sure we are working on it
2013-09-12 12:31:33	jhartigan	why sbe using it is even on his radar at this point i dont know.  honestly dude hes a royal paint to work with
2013-09-12 12:32:30	jhartigan	also i dont know what hes talking about wih char modifying her shit
2013-09-12 12:32:41	jhartigan	but as usual you never know what hes trying to actually say
2013-09-12 12:33:34	kweaver_laptop	eh, Im not pained by him just checking up to see how things are going. it's not like he's making any assertions about needing it asap, just looking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:33:48	kweaver_laptop	for shit**
2013-09-12 12:34:06	jhartigan	thats not what hes doing
2013-09-12 12:34:09	jhartigan	i guarantee you
2013-09-12 12:34:33	jhartigan	next time we talk to him hell be under the assumption that cumberland completion means heroes in a month
2013-09-12 12:34:38	jhartigan	its how he operatres
2013-09-12 12:34:55	jhartigan	i spent 8 months being his sole contact and he couldnt get anything straight no matter how often hes told
2013-09-12 12:37:39	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants to know what to tell them, that's all.  I would want to do the same.  He said it before, he has no problem just telling them that it's billing only for now. He just wants to make sure that is still the case
2013-09-12 12:38:32	jhartigan	sbe has nothing to do with that
2013-09-12 12:38:52	kweaver_laptop	I didnt read his email as any sort of rush
2013-09-12 12:38:57	kweaver_laptop	just asking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:39:01	kweaver_laptop	2014? 2015?

2013-09-12 13:23:47	kweaver_laptop	do you remember what that setting was?
2013-09-12 13:31:50	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I just checked, the A record is correct, and the SSL just ties into "irm.theflandershotel.com"
2013-09-12 13:37:31	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: I switched the A record to just "irm" since we have the mail A record as just "mail"
2013-09-12 13:37:36	kweaver_laptop	I would assume that is it
2013-09-12 13:38:20	kweaver_laptop	cpanel lists out the entire A record in their DNS settings, where as DO just wants the subdomain
2013-09-12 13:39:49	kweaver_laptop	I'm so pissed too because I specifically checked if the order was working last night, but my stupid network was still looking at the old site

2013-09-17 15:46:48	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: kweaver yo man. so sorry i didnt even hear you call.
2013-09-17 15:47:27	kweaver_laptop	lol I assumed at this point that you went to the hospital or something
2013-09-17 15:48:39	jhartigan	i was dreaming about some bullshit related to flanders, so i thought i was awake
2013-09-17 15:49:02	jhartigan	and then i woke up and realized i was out for almost 20 hours
2013-09-17 15:49:50	kweaver_laptop	I think its considered a coma at that point..
2013-09-17 15:50:05	kweaver_laptop	well at least youre alive
2013-09-17 15:50:07	kweaver_laptop	so thats good
2013-09-17 15:51:37	kweaver_laptop	so dougs site issue is a combination of his network already using the landistitle.com domain for shit, and our www cname record not being set up as its supposed to
2013-09-17 15:51:45	kweaver_laptop	if you go to www.omni-dev.com
2013-09-17 15:51:50	kweaver_laptop	youll notice the www stays there
2013-09-17 15:52:13	kweaver_laptop	if you go to any of our DO sites, www just redirects to the domain without the www.
2013-09-17 15:52:33	kweaver_laptop	so Im trying to set up our records to not drop the www, since that is what we will need to get in from his network
2013-09-17 15:53:09	jhartigan	that doesnt make ansy sense from a logical stand point
2013-09-17 15:53:14	jhartigan	www. is just a subdomain
2013-09-17 15:53:20	jhartigan	it actually doesnt affect any routing
2013-09-17 15:59:27	kweaver_laptop	brandon went in through his server and explained it briefly
2013-09-17 15:59:46	kweaver_laptop	he said the people that set up their network initially set landistitle.com to an internal ip
2013-09-17 16:00:14	kweaver_laptop	therefore, whenever they wanted to get to the site, the had to use www. which pointed out to the website ip
2013-09-17 16:03:17	kweaver_laptop	but since we have www.landistitle.com just forward over to landistitle.com, its pointing back to their internal ip which has nothing for the site
2013-09-17 16:04:47	jhartigan	oh dear god
2013-09-17 16:04:55	jhartigan	they hosted his site on his own serer?
2013-09-17 16:05:19	jhartigan	just swapping server name and alias should do the trick
2013-09-17 16:05:39	jhartigan	here i am digging in the fail2ban settings making sure doug didnt get banned
2013-09-17 16:07:44	kweaver_laptop	ima swap the alias and name now
2013-09-17 16:08:05	jhartigan	do that and a reload
2013-09-17 16:10:50	kweaver_laptop	done
2013-09-17 16:10:57	kweaver_laptop	now im getting a dns error for it on DO
2013-09-17 16:11:39	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: 
2013-09-17 16:12:57	jhartigan	okay so that doesnt fix it..
2013-09-17 16:13:00	jhartigan	hmm
2013-09-17 16:15:50	kweaver_laptop	I tried like every combination of cname and a record for it
2013-09-17 16:16:08	kweaver_laptop	compared it to omni-dev's cpanel since those records work fine
2013-09-17 16:20:22	jhartigan	the only thing i can think of is with server name as www. no alias
2013-09-17 16:20:34	jhartigan	and a record for it as www. with no cname
2013-09-17 16:23:07	jhartigan	why didnt brandon remove the internal ip
2013-09-17 16:23:25	jhartigan	not that this is hi fault
2013-09-17 16:23:32	jhartigan	just a silly thing to leave up and running
2013-09-17 16:26:35	kweaver_laptop	not sure, maybe other shit relying on it?
2013-09-17 16:27:05	jhartigan	dunno. thats just shitty use of your domain.  i added www.landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:27:28	jhartigan	i dont think we move the mail over
2013-09-17 16:27:36	kweaver_laptop	?
2013-09-17 16:27:48	jhartigan	but probably need a vhost that serves only www.landis with no alias
2013-09-17 16:28:19	kweaver_laptop	thats a possibility
2013-09-17 16:30:24	kweaver_laptop	you added www.landistitle.com to what?
2013-09-17 16:30:49	kweaver_laptop	im going to try www.landistitile.com with no alias
2013-09-17 16:31:13	jhartigan	i already made the vhost
2013-09-17 16:31:17	jhartigan	and changed the original
2013-09-17 16:31:34	jhartigan	wait on some popigation for the www.landistitle.com domain on the digital ocean
2013-09-17 16:31:37	jhartigan	should onl be a sec
2013-09-17 16:31:38	kweaver_laptop	k
2013-09-17 16:33:40	jhartigan	whyd you add a wildcard subdomain?
2013-09-17 16:33:49	jhartigan	is that there for something important on landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:34:39	kweaver_laptop	nah, just noticed it on the DO docs and thought its probably a good idea to use on other sites as well
2013-09-17 16:34:40	kweaver_laptop	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean
2013-09-17 16:34:42	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: ?   if not i need to yank the * and www
2013-09-17 16:34:46	jhartigan	oh yeah
2013-09-17 16:34:48	jhartigan	i gotcha
2013-09-17 16:35:11	jhartigan	alright well that record was destroyed
2013-09-17 16:35:17	jhartigan	until that propigates upstream
2013-09-17 16:35:23	jhartigan	we cant really test the www. one
2013-09-17 16:35:42	kweaver_laptop	thats fine
2013-09-17 16:48:53	kweaver_laptop	any luck jhartigan ?
2013-09-17 16:49:00	kweaver_laptop	its still doing the same for me
2013-09-17 16:50:11	jhartigan	mines still dropping www. as well
2013-09-17 16:50:28	jhartigan	only been 15 but i would hope it would have went upstream
2013-09-17 17:00:07	jhartigan	man i followed everything i saw online to a t
2013-09-17 17:00:15	jhartigan	dunno why the new domains not resolving
2013-09-17 17:05:21	kweaver_laptop	bleh
2013-09-17 17:06:18	jhartigan	yeah i dunno
2013-09-17 17:06:37	jhartigan	it could be now a combination of the new configs trickling up to top level shit and local caching
2013-09-17 17:06:46	jhartigan	this is such a shit problem to have
2013-09-17 17:06:48	kweaver_laptop	yeah
2013-09-17 17:06:58	kweaver_laptop	it takes 20 minutes anytime you want to see if it worked

2013-09-20 11:44:34	kweaver	theres also some neat features like team share where I guess you can share juice ssh sessions on other devices
2013-09-20 11:45:00	kweaver	thatd be kinda neat to check out sharing between the phone and tablet
2013-09-20 11:48:27	jhartigan	yeah i saw that on there

2013-09-20 12:46:30	jharty	thats cool
2013-09-20 12:46:35	jharty	should we do write offs instead?
2013-09-20 12:46:37	jharty	or nah
2013-09-20 12:46:43	jharty	cause we could always agree that its 10 hours
2013-09-20 12:46:51	jharty	and get 600 + 300 in write offs for taxes
2013-09-20 12:47:02	jharty	kweaver: im gonna leave to drop this off for amanda soo

2013-09-20 12:51:20	jharty	i mean if you want. maybe call her back and tell her you have an idea that could work for both of us
2013-09-20 12:51:32	jharty	even if next year its free hosting and 500 in writeoffs
2013-09-20 12:51:36	jharty	its still writeoffs i guess

2013-09-20 12:52:19	jharty	Freelance professionals often have non-profits and charities as clients. Oftentimes the freelancer will agree to work for free because they believe in the work the non-profit is doing and want to cut them a break on their fees. So the question naturally arises, "Is freelance work done for charity deductible?" (This interesting question was sent to me by a reader via twitter.)
2013-09-20 12:52:22	jharty	The short answer is no
2013-09-20 12:52:23	jharty	maybe not

2013-10-01 10:50:20	kweaver	I was gonna call brian today and ask about kings custom clothiers

2013-10-01 10:52:27	kweaver	so I quoted $3000, she asked tim and brian if we could do $1500, I sent her a new quote with $1500, and a few less pages, she responded asking if "the site will still remain a $3000 value" and asked for a few of the pages to be put back in the scope
2013-10-01 10:52:29	kweaver	lololol
2013-10-01 10:52:49	kweaver	russo is on my list of reachouts, his last response was that they got really busy and he'd reach out soon

2013-10-01 12:15:24	jhartigan	it was a pretty shitty logo but i guess my recreation of shit was pretty stellar
2013-10-01 13:07:36	kweaver	jhartigan: I dont think casa is happening

2013-10-01 13:11:57	jhartigan	im working on some lunch at the moment.  whats good in the hood
2013-10-01 13:12:27	kweaver	just trying to figure out where we will be when Im done the photoshop work
2013-10-01 13:12:32	kweaver	hows everything on the drupal end?
2013-10-01 13:13:04	jhartigan	durpals installed and theres a sub theme
2013-10-01 13:13:06	jhartigan	its been that way
2013-10-01 13:13:11	kweaver	whats the parent theme?
2013-10-01 13:13:28	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon one
2013-10-01 13:13:42	jhartigan	which is sass/bouron of drupal default
2013-10-01 13:14:23	kweaver	did you add those to the default theme, or was there one you downloaded?
2013-10-01 13:14:32	jhartigan	hm?
2013-10-01 13:15:04	kweaver	did you just download sass/bourbon and use the default theme?
2013-10-01 13:15:11	kweaver	or was there a prepacked one you downloaded
2013-10-01 13:15:14	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon module comes with a theme which is default but preprocesses
2013-10-01 13:15:45	kweaver	ok, so its a seperate theme than the default one that comes with drupal
2013-10-01 13:15:47	kweaver	thats fine
2013-10-01 13:15:54	kweaver	you can deactivate the default drupal theme
2013-10-01 13:15:58	kweaver	we wont be using that at all
2013-10-01 13:16:45	kweaver	what's your next step then after lunch?
2013-10-01 13:16:57	kweaver	im going to assume that the remaining psd shit is going to at least take another day
2013-10-01 13:17:14	kweaver	and tomorrow is bc fun day
2013-10-01 13:17:36	jhartigan	oh shit thats right you have that css shit to do

2013-10-02 10:37:56	jhartigan	yo that cron job seems to be kicking ass and taking names on the server
2013-10-02 10:38:13	jhartigan	ii learned that cache is a bunch of shit. like moved files and stuff
2013-10-02 10:38:17	jhartigan	db entries im sure
2013-10-02 11:45:09	kweaver_laptop	nice jhartigan 
2013-10-02 11:45:26	kweaver_laptop	what ram usage have we been averaging?
2013-10-02 11:45:43	jhartigan	the only thing is.. im hearin you shouldnt need to use it. and essentially youre putting pressure onto the cpu
2013-10-02 11:45:57	jhartigan	like 1200 free has been the highest use ive seen since
2013-10-02 11:46:30	jhartigan	im wondering if theres a swappiness setting i should look at to aleviate it without clearing cache... although its not liek we touch our cpu power
2013-10-02 11:47:52	kweaver_laptop	yeah I dont imagine a custom cron job is that most ideal or average way that people handle it
2013-10-02 11:48:01	kweaver_laptop	but its a start until we find out what that is
2013-10-02 11:49:16	jhartigan	yeah its just odd cause ive never had the problem with anything before
2013-10-02 11:49:22	jhartigan	i think its actually a swappiness setting
2013-10-02 11:49:30	jhartigan	which dictates when to throw shit into the cahce
2013-10-02 11:49:32	jhartigan	cache*
2013-10-02 12:20:01	jhartigan	testing something thats a supposed proper fix for the server

2013-10-09 14:21:23	kweaver	AJPGTUSATVFS3L5TC7A4GGOWCHOIGYP4T
2013-10-09 14:21:25	kweaver	so you dont have to find it

2013-10-09 14:22:15	jhartigan	birdlady and steamicon?
2013-10-09 14:22:20	kweaver	yup
2013-10-09 14:22:32	kweaver	once we have raspberry guy pulling website backups, we should have him take backups of bitsync
2013-10-09 14:22:35	jhartigan	got them instantly on openeing my ac
2013-10-09 14:22:38	kweaver	in case anything happens
2013-10-09 14:22:51	jhartigan	what do you mean
2013-10-09 14:24:25	kweaver	basically just copy the entire bitsync folder, maybe once a week or so, save the last 5 or something
2013-10-09 14:24:40	jhartigan	yeah,. but we were just gonna host it on the pi
2013-10-09 14:24:47	jhartigan	so the pi always has a btsync serve
2013-10-09 14:24:53	jhartigan	and then we always get the files / changes
2013-10-09 14:25:00	jhartigan	so wouldnt that be better haha?
2013-10-09 14:25:02	jhartigan	also
2013-10-09 14:25:06	jhartigan	this shits fucking fast and awesome
2013-10-09 14:25:12	jhartigan	i just set up the secret on my desktop
2013-10-09 14:25:19	kweaver	yeah we would do that also, but copying it  would give us backups
2013-10-09 14:25:23	jhartigan	and its like OHMYGODTHERESFIELSTOGET
2013-10-09 14:25:39	kweaver	just fallbacks
2013-10-09 14:25:56	jhartigan	im not following you at all
2013-10-09 14:26:03	jhartigan	they are synced on different machines
2013-10-09 14:26:06	jhartigan	what are you backing up
2013-10-09 14:26:30	kweaver	our bitsync folder is going to become our everything in the world resources folder
2013-10-09 14:26:33	kweaver	with every psd
2013-10-09 14:26:43	kweaver	every website resource
2013-10-09 14:26:46	kweaver	every font
2013-10-09 14:26:48	kweaver	that we will ever use
2013-10-09 14:27:14	kweaver	Im suggesting that we create backups of that
2013-10-09 14:27:32	jhartigan	but youre suggessting backups of massive files that are not stored on 4 different machines
2013-10-09 14:27:32	kweaver	in case someone rm-r 's by accident and we lose everything we've ever done
2013-10-09 14:27:47	kweaver	4 different machines that are synced together
2013-10-09 14:27:47	jhartigan	deleted files go into .syncarchive
2013-10-09 14:27:53	jhartigan	so they dont go anywhere
2013-10-09 14:28:30	kweaver	so delete a file on a computer wont reflect the deletion on any other?
2013-10-09 14:28:34	kweaver	deleting**
2013-10-09 14:29:33	kweaver	oh damn okay
2013-10-09 14:29:36	jhartigan	unless you just got my deletions nope
2013-10-09 14:29:58	jhartigan	its in the archive now
2013-10-09 14:30:05	jhartigan	its a pretty cool service
2013-10-09 14:30:13	jhartigan	basically deleting it.. moves it out of sync for everyone
2013-10-09 14:30:15	jhartigan	but they keep it
2013-10-09 14:30:21	jhartigan	its actually badass as all hell
2013-10-09 14:31:04	kweaver	damnnn thats cool
2013-10-09 14:31:08	kweaver	yeah I didnt know it did that
2013-10-09 14:31:56	kweaver	if anything, there may still be reason enough for at least one backup, especially if we're tied to a 2-4TB hdd
2013-10-09 14:32:47	kweaver	there have been at least 2 times in my career where I've gone to save something, and accidently saved it over another file
2013-10-09 14:32:54	kweaver	i just did it last week with our omni site
2013-10-09 14:33:16	kweaver	saved fullsite.psd over graphic-design.psd by accident
2013-10-09 14:33:20	kweaver	and then its beat street
2013-10-09 14:33:58	jhartigan	probably best to use a workflow like project/workspace for all psds and then project/exports
2013-10-09 14:34:52	kweaver	what would exports be?
2013-10-09 14:35:32	jhartigan	actual images
2013-10-09 14:35:45	jhartigan	i mean saving overshit its always a danger
2013-10-09 14:35:57	jhartigan	a single weeklong backup probably doesnt prevent that
2013-10-09 14:36:31	kweaver	well we can decide what sort of backups we want to make depending on how much space we've got to work with
2013-10-09 14:36:59	kweaver	ill drop a little extra if it means no worries
2013-10-09 14:37:03	jhartigan	yeah thats not a problem.  its just one pi backing up massive psds
2013-10-09 14:37:12	jhartigan	isnt gonna be the same as getting compressed images and text
2013-10-09 14:37:20	kweaver	I think mazz said his office has a shit load of backups
2013-10-09 14:38:21	jhartigan	im sure they do
2013-10-09 14:39:15	kweaver	alright jhartigan, you might want to turn off bitsync notifications
2013-10-09 14:39:20	kweaver	im gonna start reorganizing everything
2013-10-09 14:39:43	jhartigan	they also dont run them over a pi.  im sure it can handle it, but depending on the backup schedule that folder is gonna shit the bed for the pi
2013-10-09 14:39:49	jhartigan	haha are they obnoxious?
2013-10-09 14:40:03	jhartigan	they arent bad on my mac?
2013-10-09 14:40:08	jhartigan	that wasnt a question hah
2013-10-09 14:40:09	kweaver	not sure, I just know ive got 23k files in box now
2013-10-09 14:40:23	kweaver	i dont think I have them turned on here
2013-10-09 14:40:25	kweaver	ill find out
2013-10-09 14:40:34	jhartigan	structure it how you see fit and well see what happens over here
2013-10-09 14:43:06	kweaver	hmmmm
2013-10-09 14:43:57	kweaver	let me sit/shit on it
2013-10-09 14:44:13	jhartigan	thats gross!
2013-10-09 15:33:26	jhartigan	the menus working. i think ittll look good as a sticky one and is a good break from the parallax should someone scroll past its current location
2013-10-09 15:33:35	jhartigan	so pooryly worded
2013-10-09 15:33:37	jhartigan	back to the top
2013-10-09 15:57:39	kweaver	sweet jhartigan
2013-10-09 15:57:57	kweaver	Im organizing this stuff locally, then I'll move it all into bitsync last
2013-10-09 15:58:10	jhartigan	yeah thats cool
2013-10-09 15:58:15	jhartigan	i figured thats best
2013-10-09 15:58:27	jhartigan	btsync is seriously impressive kweaver
2013-10-09 15:58:37	jhartigan	like insanely awesome
2013-10-09 15:58:38	kweaver	jhartigan:  I wonder if things  would poop itself if we nested our local google Drive root directories inside our bitsync folders?
2013-10-09 15:58:59	jhartigan	i wouldnt bother
2013-10-09 15:59:02	jhartigan	thats redundant
2013-10-09 15:59:05	jhartigan	if youre gonna keep it in drive
2013-10-09 15:59:09	jhartigan	its always online/offline
2013-10-09 15:59:44	kweaver	yeah, It doesnt really have to.  it would just be really nice to just consolidate our documents too
2013-10-09 15:59:53	kweaver	thats kinda the last piece of the puzz
2013-10-09 16:00:18	kweaver	might not be worth the headache if things break though
2013-10-09 16:00:52	jhartigan	yeha i mean if you wanna consolidate docs that way. we can export from drive
2013-10-09 16:00:55	jhartigan	into hard files
2013-10-09 16:00:57	jhartigan	and go thatroute
2013-10-09 16:01:02	jhartigan	but drive is good at that
2013-10-09 16:01:11	jhartigan	documents and resources are a lil different i guess

2013-10-14 15:42:20	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  how goes ghost?
2013-10-14 15:47:01	jhartigan	who knows
2013-10-14 15:47:05	jhartigan	being a bit of a pain
2013-10-14 15:48:58	jhartigan	trying a couple differnt things   found one guy who ran it with nginx so im adapting it
2013-10-14 15:49:10	jhartigan	i think the installs fine actually its jut not showing up on that port or something
2013-10-14 16:48:59	kweaver_laptop	would it be worth using nginx as well?
2013-10-14 16:49:08	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I know thats what tom uses
2013-10-14 16:49:13	kweaver_laptop	instead of apache
2013-10-14 16:57:31	jhartigan	nginx is awesome
2013-10-14 16:57:38	jhartigan	its a bit more complicated for php
2013-10-14 16:57:43	jhartigan	but i can figure it out if we wanna do that
2013-10-14 16:58:05	jhartigan	should i use a second server.. set one up tonight? i 1gb jira / omni-blog and demo server?
2013-10-14 16:58:08	jhartigan	dev*
2013-10-14 16:58:15	jhartigan	gonna go feed my dog and take her out

2013-10-14 17:17:10	kweaver_laptop	yeah I think we should always have a second server running for testies
2013-10-14 17:17:31	kweaver_laptop	theres still a lot for us to play with on the server end 
2013-10-14 17:17:35	kweaver_laptop	stuff like nginx
2013-10-14 17:18:24	kweaver_laptop	1 gb jira wouldnt work though, right?

2013-10-17 09:44:12	jhartigan	run that dist upgrade
2013-10-17 10:56:09	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: I got halfway done a single page, general coming soon page  last night
2013-10-17 10:56:23	kweaver_laptop	www.kingscustomclothiers.com
2013-10-17 10:56:30	kweaver_laptop	no images
2013-10-17 10:56:43	kweaver_laptop	and my end goal once it its done is to compile everything down to one file
2013-10-17 10:56:48	kweaver_laptop	index.html
2013-10-17 10:56:55	kweaver_laptop	booom
2013-10-17 10:57:06	jhartigan	i like that alot
2013-10-17 10:57:10	jhartigan	looks really good
2013-10-17 10:57:45	kweaver_laptop	its not done yet, but the rest is pretty low priority so ill get to it another day
2013-10-17 10:58:37	kweaver_laptop	3 main layers,  a radial shadow, a data-png noise and a data-png diagonal line 
2013-10-17 10:58:39	jhartigan	it doesnt really need anything else
2013-10-17 10:59:55	kweaver_laptop	well, I had an interesting concept for it
2013-10-17 11:00:10	kweaver_laptop	that was sort of the whole point to it
2013-10-17 11:00:16	kweaver_laptop	but ill do that another day
2013-10-17 11:33:55	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: loos like I might have 3 calls with new potential clients today
2013-10-17 11:34:32	kweaver_laptop	before I do that thoguh, Im going to take the notes I have from the business interaction model videos and turn them into a super in depth list of straight forward questions
2013-10-17 11:35:12	kweaver_laptop	then once our drupal site is done, I figure we should just turn it into a webform in a secret url of our site
2013-10-17 11:35:19	jhartigan	thats awesome.. who we got other than the dentist?
2013-10-17 11:35:24	jhartigan	wat?
2013-10-17 11:35:38	kweaver_laptop	tony from bc has 2
2013-10-17 11:35:58	kweaver_laptop	wat?
2013-10-17 11:36:11	jhartigan	whered drupal come back from
2013-10-17 11:36:17	jhartigan	am i stopping node then?
2013-10-17 11:36:22	jhartigan	node/ghost*
2013-10-17 11:37:01	kweaver_laptop	ohhhhhh I was pretty sure we were on different pages before when we talked about it
2013-10-17 11:37:14	kweaver_laptop	i was under the impression that you wanted to have drupal for the main site
2013-10-17 11:37:21	kweaver_laptop	and then /blog would go to a ghost install
2013-10-17 11:37:30	jhartigan	lol
2013-10-17 11:37:34	jhartigan	why would we do that haha
2013-10-17 11:37:50	kweaver_laptop	for drupal practice and and functionality
2013-10-17 11:37:56	kweaver_laptop	and for ghost " " "
2013-10-17 11:38:02	jhartigan	i mean drupal isnt just a blog sure, but using a cms to not handle content would be odd
2013-10-17 11:38:18	jhartigan	yeah and it spending less time on shit that we could also practice on and make money with
2013-10-17 11:38:34	kweaver_laptop	were you thinking just a static site then?  with /blog as a ghost install?
2013-10-17 11:38:40	kweaver_laptop	or create an entire ghost theme
2013-10-17 11:38:52	jhartigan	yeah given thats what i had said. i didnt realize at all you still wanted drupal
2013-10-17 11:39:44	kweaver_laptop	lol I remember asking in the BC parking lot if you were just planning on doing everything in ghost then, and you were like "nooo dude, just the blog part of it"
2013-10-17 11:40:09	jhartigan	yeah
2013-10-17 11:40:45	kweaver_laptop	my impression was that we should eventually have a setup similar to tom and matts site.  we'd have a portfolio section with creatable portfolio items
2013-10-17 11:40:47	jhartigan	cause when i asked i said "we can go drupal or do a static site and try out ghost"
2013-10-17 11:40:55	jhartigan	i dont care
2013-10-17 11:40:58	jhartigan	we can do that
2013-10-17 11:41:00	kweaver_laptop	I dont care either
2013-10-17 11:41:01	kweaver_laptop	haha
2013-10-17 11:41:10	jhartigan	but were gonna extend our work over three weeks without any focus on cash
2013-10-17 11:41:17	jhartigan	thats not smart when we have cash options
2013-10-17 11:41:33	jhartigan	and im all for getting shit in line for the business end of things
2013-10-17 11:41:44	jhartigan	but theres no reason to run ghost blog and drupal
2013-10-17 11:41:47	jhartigan	well just use drupal
2013-10-17 11:42:56	kweaver_laptop	I figured once we had a static site, the rest of the theming, portfolio building, blogging, and any other functionality could be back burnered behind getting cash
2013-10-17 11:43:15	kweaver_laptop	so whether that is drupal or ghost, it doesnt matter too much to me
2013-10-17 11:43:19	kweaver_laptop	wed learn shit either way
2013-10-17 11:43:28	kweaver_laptop	drupal might be a more profitable learning
2013-10-17 11:43:31	jhartigan	i mean sure but then youre building a car
2013-10-17 11:43:35	jhartigan	and turning it into a plane
2013-10-17 11:43:39	jhartigan	instead of building a plane
2013-10-17 11:43:51	kweaver_laptop	how so?
2013-10-17 11:44:02	jhartigan	static site with ghost blog, which we wont use
2013-10-17 11:44:06	jhartigan	turned into a drupal site
2013-10-17 11:44:13	jhartigan	with whole a theme
2013-10-17 11:44:17	jhartigan	and another blog
2013-10-17 11:44:44	kweaver_laptop	ah gotcha
2013-10-17 11:44:49	kweaver_laptop	alright well lets think mvp
2013-10-17 11:45:15	kweaver_laptop	after I write up this list, im 100% just going to finish this paralax and get the static site done
2013-10-17 11:45:40	kweaver_laptop	if the ghost install is going to take more than 10 minutes, then ill leave it up to you if you think its worth it
2013-10-17 11:45:55	kweaver_laptop	i just thought it would be a 10 minute install that we could tinker with and see if we like it
2013-10-17 11:46:03	kweaver_laptop	if its causing problems, then its up to you
2013-10-17 11:46:03	jhartigan	its well over 10min
2013-10-17 11:46:15	jhartigan	i already did a partial on our server and it took 40
2013-10-17 11:46:27	jhartigan	thats why im confused
2013-10-17 11:46:34	jhartigan	i just want to know what were committing to
2013-10-17 11:46:43	jhartigan	switching between ghost and drupal is a waste of time
2013-10-17 11:47:16	jhartigan	and server resources since ghost requires a nodejs server running. which isnt a ton of overhead
2013-10-17 11:47:24	jhartigan	but something to consider nonetheless i suppose
2013-10-17 11:47:52	kweaver_laptop	damn, didnt know that
2013-10-17 11:48:03	jhartigan	yeah its built on node
2013-10-17 11:48:11	jhartigan	so you run a cron node server to keep her running
2013-10-17 11:48:11	kweaver_laptop	alright well if we are thinking in terms of our greatest potential end goal
2013-10-17 11:48:24	kweaver_laptop	i would say we just stick to drupal
2013-10-17 11:48:26	jhartigan	uses sqlite3 for the db by default
2013-10-17 11:48:44	kweaver_laptop	and install ghost on a test site just to learn and see if we like it
2013-10-17 11:49:07	kweaver_laptop	but not anytime soon
2013-10-17 11:50:46	kweaver_laptop	my priority list is this:  1.  build static site   2. build some sort of cms to attach to it    3. do a few more client projects to money  4. add functionality (portfolio, blog etc)
2013-10-17 11:51:10	kweaver_laptop	thoughts?
2013-10-17 11:51:15	jhartigan	alrighty sounds good to me
2013-10-17 11:51:52	kweaver_laptop	alright cool
2013-10-17 11:51:58	kweaver_laptop	I keep getting tweets from lingotek
2013-10-17 11:52:01	kweaver_laptop	and I dont care aboutthem
2013-10-17 11:52:06	jhartigan	unfollow
2013-10-17 11:52:15	jhartigan	all i wanted was your tshirt and your nexus

2013-10-17 11:52:38	kweaver_laptop	pshhh
2013-10-17 11:52:46	kweaver_laptop	youre wrong lingotek
2013-10-17 11:52:52	jhartigan	are they DMs?
2013-10-17 11:53:11	kweaver_laptop	district managers?
2013-10-17 11:53:18	jhartigan	direct messages haha
2013-10-17 11:53:23	kweaver_laptop	oh haha
2013-10-17 11:53:24	kweaver_laptop	nah
2013-10-17 11:53:31	kweaver_laptop	but I had them on notifications
2013-10-17 11:53:37	jhartigan	oh
2013-10-17 11:53:37	kweaver_laptop	in hopes of a nexus 7
2013-10-17 11:53:40	jhartigan	for the nexus
2013-10-17 11:53:42	jhartigan	gotchu
2013-10-17 11:54:22	jhartigan	yo also. i was thinkin about the logo.  for readability sake on cards and shit. what if we took and used a really clean and thin font like google uses for the word nexus and use the same for colors
2013-10-17 11:54:22	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  you still down for going out for melissas bday tomorrow?
2013-10-17 11:55:05	jhartigan	uh probably. where too?  i just dropped nearly a 1k on loans and CC
2013-10-17 11:55:17	kweaver_laptop	yeah thats an option,  once Im done the parallax, I planned on going back and doing like 3 variations of the logo
2013-10-17 11:55:27	kweaver_laptop	oh jam, yeah ill find out
2013-10-17 11:55:32	kweaver_laptop	i think it might be philly though :/
2013-10-17 11:55:46	jhartigan	yeah cause i really like the ribbon look whith that render, but i worry about it on cards and shit
2013-10-17 11:55:48	kweaver_laptop	if you cant its no bigs either
2013-10-17 11:55:57	jhartigan	yeah. it just depends on where i guess
2013-10-17 11:55:57	kweaver_laptop	yeah me too
2013-10-17 11:56:04	kweaver_laptop	I like having two discussions at once
2013-10-17 11:56:08	kweaver_laptop	its efficient
2013-10-17 11:56:19	jhartigan	i  just dont wanna barhoop to 3 places all with covers and shit
2013-10-17 11:56:24	jhartigan	haha so true
2013-10-17 11:56:39	jhartigan	i was gonna do a quick mockup for you
2013-10-17 11:56:52	jhartigan	but googling google nexus font yieled me with droid sans
2013-10-17 11:56:58	kweaver_laptop	yeah I like the ribbon two, but I cant justify putting that implementation of it on a card if I have to worry that people cant read it
2013-10-17 11:57:05	jhartigan	yeah i had the AC bill to cover and then the union tix
2013-10-17 11:57:12	jhartigan	so my CC was higher than usual
2013-10-17 11:57:27	kweaver_laptop	Ill try a couple variations of it
2013-10-17 11:57:28	jhartigan	yeah exactly. oh i made us an omni reddit
2013-10-17 11:57:41	jhartigan	every monrning i troll for hire and craigslist now
2013-10-17 11:57:48	kweaver_laptop	yeah I saw in the jira
2013-10-17 11:58:01	kweaver_laptop	I want to see if I can set notifications in the jira app
2013-10-17 11:58:04	jhartigan	oh true.. forgot im trying to use that shit and be all organized
2013-10-17 11:58:43	kweaver_laptop	I think one thing that will be make us use jira more is some sort of unobtrusive notifications when we do stuff
2013-10-17 11:58:49	kweaver_laptop	emails might clutter up the inbox
2013-10-17 11:59:06	jhartigan	yeah i already filtered and skipped inbox
2013-10-17 11:59:08	jhartigan	lol
2013-10-17 11:59:49	kweaver_laptop	nah the app doesnt offer notifications
2013-10-17 11:59:51	kweaver_laptop	thats silly
2013-10-17 11:59:58	jhartigan	maybe for 5/month
2013-10-17 12:00:00	jhartigan	lolol
2013-10-17 12:00:02	kweaver_laptop	probably
2013-10-17 12:00:03	jhartigan	or two
2013-10-17 12:00:06	jhartigan	or whatever it was
2013-10-17 12:00:10	jhartigan	fucking silly aass app
2013-10-17 12:00:23	kweaver_laptop	all I need to know is that you want to charge memore than the service itself
2013-10-17 12:00:26	jhartigan	android aint there yet.. especially if youre selling something that accesses someone elses product
2013-10-17 12:00:27	kweaver_laptop	and im out

2013-10-17 12:02:48	kweaver_laptop	I think its probably good that the gmail is in all caps
2013-10-17 12:02:56	kweaver_laptop	just to keep it different than every site we sign up on
2013-10-17 12:03:02	kweaver_laptop	that was my plan

2013-10-17 14:03:32	kweaver_laptop	I would so much rather be editting all my docs in vim
2013-10-17 14:03:45	jhartigan	looks old and unupdated though
2013-10-17 14:03:49	jhartigan	anything on github?

2013-10-17 14:07:29	kweaver_laptop	dont see anything
2013-10-17 14:07:44	jhartigan	might be api change limitations
2013-10-17 14:10:25	kweaver_laptop	just installed it 
2013-10-17 14:10:43	kweaver_laptop	trying everything out
2013-10-17 14:10:55	kweaver_laptop	google calendar list to see all calendar events works
2013-10-17 14:13:12	kweaver_laptop	setting up docs now

2013-10-17 14:24:52	kweaver_laptop	still messing with the config to set vim as the default editor
2013-10-17 14:25:01	kweaver_laptop	it looks like it should work fine though
2013-10-17 14:29:38	kweaver_laptop	awwww yeah

2013-10-17 14:30:08	jhartigan	does it edit the web doc or local?
2013-10-17 14:30:34	kweaver_laptop	pretty sweet too, you set which program you want for each type of file.  libre for excel docs etc
2013-10-17 14:31:21	kweaver_laptop	looks like it saves a local version, and then writes up the server version on save
2013-10-17 14:31:29	kweaver_laptop	so you wouldnt want to have someone else in there too
2013-10-17 14:31:48	jhartigan	yeah
2013-10-17 14:31:51	jhartigan	if only covim worked
2013-10-17 14:32:11	kweaver_laptop	yeah we should eventually look into that again.  or some variation

2013-10-17 15:46:34	kweaver_laptop	yeah theres like a 50% chance that it throws an error and wont save to docs
2013-10-17 15:46:54	kweaver_laptop	itll save locally though, so I can just try again and copy it over
2013-10-17 15:47:00	kweaver_laptop	but thats still pretty shitty
2013-10-17 15:47:11	kweaver_laptop	googled the error and they said to updated to the newest version

2013-10-17 16:52:06	kweaver_laptop	yeah im pretty sure the whole docs -> drive movement was within the last year
2013-10-17 16:52:12	kweaver_laptop	that brought about some major change

2013-10-18 10:18:37	kweaver_laptop	lol @ dyrkro.  "tom look how drunk I was!  I dont even remember writing that!"
2013-10-18 10:20:40	jhartigan	i thought it wouldve been something halfway relevant... like "ask tommyvo how to make this work"
2013-10-18 10:22:49	kweaver_laptop	https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=192557
2013-10-18 10:25:04	kweaver_laptop	confluence seems to integrate pretty well with jira
2013-10-18 10:25:13	kweaver_laptop	and its costs $10....
2013-10-18 10:25:14	kweaver_laptop	total
2013-10-18 10:26:27	kweaver_laptop	it seems to be more in the realm of the project management and customer relationship manangement realm
2013-10-18 10:26:46	jhartigan	fuck i like that it offers fuckin templates that will sit there and you can edit and save
2013-10-18 10:26:51	jhartigan	docs makes that a hassle
2013-10-18 10:27:32	kweaver_laptop	yeahhhh docs probably shouldnt be used the way we use them
2013-10-18 10:27:32	kweaver_laptop	lol
2013-10-18 10:27:42	kweaver_laptop	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJEK6lh_cvk#t=51
2013-10-18 10:27:48	jhartigan	yeah i mean maybe not
2013-10-18 10:28:07	jhartigan	but the template document idea seems like something google would strive for, given its share oriented feature
2013-10-18 10:28:24	kweaver_laptop	damn you atlassian
2013-10-18 10:30:06	kweaver_laptop	so far ive made a point out of checking/updating jira everymorning

2013-10-18 10:31:11	jhartigan	i tend to leave it open in a tab
2013-10-18 10:31:23	kweaver_laptop	shit, youre right

2013-10-18 10:33:37	jhartigan	confluence does look pretty sick
2013-10-18 10:34:32	kweaver_laptop	you should nab it
2013-10-18 10:34:43	kweaver_laptop	even if we decided we didnt like it..... it's $10
2013-10-18 10:34:49	jhartigan	yeah

2013-10-18 10:34:59	jhartigan	assuming itll run alongside jira
2013-10-18 10:35:07	jhartigan	they both shouldnt need 1g to idle
2013-10-18 10:36:13	jhartigan	ill just get it with calendars

2013-10-22 15:40:48	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: 
2013-10-22 15:41:19	jhartigan	yoyo
2013-10-22 15:41:19	kweaver_laptop	just spent the last half hour exporting the stylings of the testimonials widget from flanders catering for brian flaim
2013-10-22 15:41:34	kweaver_laptop	he said he wants their testimonials page with that look
2013-10-22 15:41:56	kweaver_laptop	but then I realized that elegant themes has all of their shortcodes in a plugin
2013-10-22 15:42:04	kweaver_laptop	lolol
2013-10-22 15:42:33	jhartigan	dudnt you have to tweak it a little bit?
2013-10-22 15:43:30	kweaver_laptop	the other plugin I used was their page editor one
2013-10-22 15:43:32	kweaver_laptop	that one broke
2013-10-22 15:43:33	kweaver_laptop	all the time
2013-10-22 15:44:54	kweaver_laptop	anyway I have it installed on BC's site now, but having an issue with the image on each testimonial 
2013-10-22 15:44:58	kweaver_laptop	seems to break the world
2013-10-22 15:45:09	kweaver_laptop	wondering if you wanted to look at too
2013-10-22 15:46:40	kweaver_laptop	I also emailed jhanna her round 2 logos
2013-10-22 15:46:41	kweaver_laptop	http://imgur.com/a/NC9eK
2013-10-22 15:47:07	jhartigan	i can loook at it as well. just for like 15 min
2013-10-22 15:47:12	jhartigan	then i gotta get ready and meet rob
2013-10-22 15:47:20	jhartigan	me him matt n your bro goin to see pearl jame
2013-10-22 15:47:23	jhartigan	jam
2013-10-22 15:47:27	jhartigan	i know youre so jelly
2013-10-22 15:49:24	jhartigan	also are we keeping ultrasonic soap
2013-10-22 15:49:30	jhartigan	did i ask that earlier?
2013-10-22 15:49:42	kweaver_laptop	yeah keep it
2013-10-22 15:49:54	kweaver_laptop	my dads weird and likes to keep sites from 1998
2013-10-22 15:51:27	jhartigan	haha thats cool. its just a mess of a directory stucture
2013-10-22 15:51:35	jhartigan	i had started trying to separate it
2013-10-22 15:51:39	jhartigan	and then i thought better of it
2013-10-22 16:00:41	kweaver_laptop	yeah
2013-10-22 16:03:52	jhartigan	so is the issue on the live page on bc?
2013-10-22 16:04:13	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  dunno if this helps at all https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-configure-and-maintain-ghost-from-the-command-line
2013-10-22 16:04:27	kweaver_laptop	digital ocean is pretty sweet with their walkthroughs
2013-10-22 16:04:41	kweaver_laptop	my issue is this jhartigan  http://bctechnologies.biz/test-testimonials/
2013-10-22 16:04:57	jhartigan	what about ghost nowww
2013-10-22 16:05:00	jhartigan	haha
2013-10-22 16:05:32	jhartigan	is there nothing on the page or did my browser shit the bed?
2013-10-22 16:05:49	kweaver_laptop	go into edit that page
2013-10-22 16:06:00	kweaver_laptop	and youll see its just a shortcode for a testimonial
2013-10-22 16:06:23	kweaver_laptop	if you delete the image link in the testimonial, the page will render fine
2013-10-22 16:08:42	jhartigan	probably cause this isnt et
2013-10-22 16:08:52	jhartigan	wasnt this a separate theme?
2013-10-22 16:10:17	kweaver_laptop	yeah, but the concept of the et-shortcodes theme is to be used any non et-theme.  those shortcodes come with every et-theme with no need for the plugin
2013-10-22 16:10:29	kweaver_laptop	and the shortcode clearly works if you remove the image
2013-10-22 16:10:37	kweaver_laptop	well ill keep looking into it
2013-10-22 16:10:59	jhartigan	yeah but they suck
2013-10-22 16:11:00	kweaver_laptop	you can get ready for your jams
2013-10-22 16:11:02	jhartigan	and this wp is updated
2013-10-22 16:11:05	jhartigan	i got a few
2013-10-22 16:11:09	jhartigan	ill keep lookin at it
2013-10-22 16:11:20	jhartigan	maybe its something to do with the new WP / jquery update
2013-10-22 16:12:39	jhartigan	whats weird is it interferes with mad css
2013-10-22 16:12:44	jhartigan	the entire nav bar doesnt render and shit
2013-10-22 16:12:49	jhartigan	WP nav bar
2013-10-22 16:15:34	jhartigan	mad errors showing up in shortcodes css
2013-10-22 16:16:20	kweaver_laptop	k keep a window open with it broken, im gonna set it without an image to compare
2013-10-22 16:16:45	jhartigan	i did

2013-10-22 16:16:53	jhartigan	nevermind
2013-10-22 16:16:58	jhartigan	false hopes
2013-10-22 16:17:20	jhartigan	but flanders testimonials does not have those errors
2013-10-22 16:18:11	kweaver_laptop	there are two shortcodes.css
2013-10-22 16:18:22	kweaver_laptop	the one with the warnings is the one that came with the theme
2013-10-22 16:18:33	kweaver_laptop	the one with no warnings is the et one
