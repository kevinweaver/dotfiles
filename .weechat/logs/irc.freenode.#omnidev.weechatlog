2013-09-12 11:51:28	kweaver_laptop	what do you think we should say to bruiz about the timeframe
2013-09-12 11:52:57	kweaver_laptop	whenever we go a couple weeks without working on heroes, I feel like we are months away from even a basic form submission. but once we work on it for a couple weeks in a row and make progress, I feel like if we wanted to, we could bang it out by the end of the month
2013-09-12 11:53:56	kweaver_laptop	everything else seems to be slowing down, so I think ill start some heroes at night again

2013-09-12 12:28:29	jhartigan	haha okay. just got worried for you
2013-09-12 12:28:31	kweaver_laptop	about working on heroes
2013-09-12 12:28:36	kweaver_laptop	did it go through?
2013-09-12 12:28:41	jhartigan	no you did not
2013-09-12 12:28:51	kweaver_laptop	might not have been on the internet yet then
2013-09-12 12:29:57	kweaver_laptop	I just asked what we wanted to say in our response to brian about where we think the program is
2013-09-12 12:30:35	kweaver_laptop	and then I was saying how whenever we work on it for a couple weeks in a row, I feel like we could totes get something basic done by the end of the month
2013-09-12 12:31:02	kweaver_laptop	but whatever we go a couple weeks without, I feel like itll be months before anything
2013-09-12 12:31:05	kweaver_laptop	whenever***
2013-09-12 12:31:07	jhartigan	well as usual
2013-09-12 12:31:10	jhartigan	brian doesnt listen
2013-09-12 12:31:24	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants a recap 
2013-09-12 12:31:31	kweaver_laptop	to make sure we are working on it
2013-09-12 12:31:33	jhartigan	why sbe using it is even on his radar at this point i dont know.  honestly dude hes a royal paint to work with
2013-09-12 12:32:30	jhartigan	also i dont know what hes talking about wih char modifying her shit
2013-09-12 12:32:41	jhartigan	but as usual you never know what hes trying to actually say
2013-09-12 12:33:34	kweaver_laptop	eh, Im not pained by him just checking up to see how things are going. it's not like he's making any assertions about needing it asap, just looking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:33:48	kweaver_laptop	for shit**
2013-09-12 12:34:06	jhartigan	thats not what hes doing
2013-09-12 12:34:09	jhartigan	i guarantee you
2013-09-12 12:34:33	jhartigan	next time we talk to him hell be under the assumption that cumberland completion means heroes in a month
2013-09-12 12:34:38	jhartigan	its how he operatres
2013-09-12 12:34:55	jhartigan	i spent 8 months being his sole contact and he couldnt get anything straight no matter how often hes told
2013-09-12 12:37:39	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants to know what to tell them, that's all.  I would want to do the same.  He said it before, he has no problem just telling them that it's billing only for now. He just wants to make sure that is still the case
2013-09-12 12:38:32	jhartigan	sbe has nothing to do with that
2013-09-12 12:38:52	kweaver_laptop	I didnt read his email as any sort of rush
2013-09-12 12:38:57	kweaver_laptop	just asking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:39:01	kweaver_laptop	2014? 2015?

2013-09-12 13:23:47	kweaver_laptop	do you remember what that setting was?
2013-09-12 13:31:50	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I just checked, the A record is correct, and the SSL just ties into "irm.theflandershotel.com"
2013-09-12 13:37:31	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: I switched the A record to just "irm" since we have the mail A record as just "mail"
2013-09-12 13:37:36	kweaver_laptop	I would assume that is it
2013-09-12 13:38:20	kweaver_laptop	cpanel lists out the entire A record in their DNS settings, where as DO just wants the subdomain
2013-09-12 13:39:49	kweaver_laptop	I'm so pissed too because I specifically checked if the order was working last night, but my stupid network was still looking at the old site

2013-09-17 15:46:48	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: kweaver yo man. so sorry i didnt even hear you call.
2013-09-17 15:47:27	kweaver_laptop	lol I assumed at this point that you went to the hospital or something
2013-09-17 15:48:39	jhartigan	i was dreaming about some bullshit related to flanders, so i thought i was awake
2013-09-17 15:49:02	jhartigan	and then i woke up and realized i was out for almost 20 hours
2013-09-17 15:49:50	kweaver_laptop	I think its considered a coma at that point..
2013-09-17 15:50:05	kweaver_laptop	well at least youre alive
2013-09-17 15:50:07	kweaver_laptop	so thats good
2013-09-17 15:51:37	kweaver_laptop	so dougs site issue is a combination of his network already using the landistitle.com domain for shit, and our www cname record not being set up as its supposed to
2013-09-17 15:51:45	kweaver_laptop	if you go to www.omni-dev.com
2013-09-17 15:51:50	kweaver_laptop	youll notice the www stays there
2013-09-17 15:52:13	kweaver_laptop	if you go to any of our DO sites, www just redirects to the domain without the www.
2013-09-17 15:52:33	kweaver_laptop	so Im trying to set up our records to not drop the www, since that is what we will need to get in from his network
2013-09-17 15:53:09	jhartigan	that doesnt make ansy sense from a logical stand point
2013-09-17 15:53:14	jhartigan	www. is just a subdomain
2013-09-17 15:53:20	jhartigan	it actually doesnt affect any routing
2013-09-17 15:59:27	kweaver_laptop	brandon went in through his server and explained it briefly
2013-09-17 15:59:46	kweaver_laptop	he said the people that set up their network initially set landistitle.com to an internal ip
2013-09-17 16:00:14	kweaver_laptop	therefore, whenever they wanted to get to the site, the had to use www. which pointed out to the website ip
2013-09-17 16:03:17	kweaver_laptop	but since we have www.landistitle.com just forward over to landistitle.com, its pointing back to their internal ip which has nothing for the site
2013-09-17 16:04:47	jhartigan	oh dear god
2013-09-17 16:04:55	jhartigan	they hosted his site on his own serer?
2013-09-17 16:05:19	jhartigan	just swapping server name and alias should do the trick
2013-09-17 16:05:39	jhartigan	here i am digging in the fail2ban settings making sure doug didnt get banned
2013-09-17 16:07:44	kweaver_laptop	ima swap the alias and name now
2013-09-17 16:08:05	jhartigan	do that and a reload
2013-09-17 16:10:50	kweaver_laptop	done
2013-09-17 16:10:57	kweaver_laptop	now im getting a dns error for it on DO
2013-09-17 16:11:39	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: 
2013-09-17 16:12:57	jhartigan	okay so that doesnt fix it..
2013-09-17 16:13:00	jhartigan	hmm
2013-09-17 16:15:50	kweaver_laptop	I tried like every combination of cname and a record for it
2013-09-17 16:16:08	kweaver_laptop	compared it to omni-dev's cpanel since those records work fine
2013-09-17 16:20:22	jhartigan	the only thing i can think of is with server name as www. no alias
2013-09-17 16:20:34	jhartigan	and a record for it as www. with no cname
2013-09-17 16:23:07	jhartigan	why didnt brandon remove the internal ip
2013-09-17 16:23:25	jhartigan	not that this is hi fault
2013-09-17 16:23:32	jhartigan	just a silly thing to leave up and running
2013-09-17 16:26:35	kweaver_laptop	not sure, maybe other shit relying on it?
2013-09-17 16:27:05	jhartigan	dunno. thats just shitty use of your domain.  i added www.landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:27:28	jhartigan	i dont think we move the mail over
2013-09-17 16:27:36	kweaver_laptop	?
2013-09-17 16:27:48	jhartigan	but probably need a vhost that serves only www.landis with no alias
2013-09-17 16:28:19	kweaver_laptop	thats a possibility
2013-09-17 16:30:24	kweaver_laptop	you added www.landistitle.com to what?
2013-09-17 16:30:49	kweaver_laptop	im going to try www.landistitile.com with no alias
2013-09-17 16:31:13	jhartigan	i already made the vhost
2013-09-17 16:31:17	jhartigan	and changed the original
2013-09-17 16:31:34	jhartigan	wait on some popigation for the www.landistitle.com domain on the digital ocean
2013-09-17 16:31:37	jhartigan	should onl be a sec
2013-09-17 16:31:38	kweaver_laptop	k
2013-09-17 16:33:40	jhartigan	whyd you add a wildcard subdomain?
2013-09-17 16:33:49	jhartigan	is that there for something important on landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:34:39	kweaver_laptop	nah, just noticed it on the DO docs and thought its probably a good idea to use on other sites as well
2013-09-17 16:34:40	kweaver_laptop	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean
2013-09-17 16:34:42	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: ?   if not i need to yank the * and www
2013-09-17 16:34:46	jhartigan	oh yeah
2013-09-17 16:34:48	jhartigan	i gotcha
2013-09-17 16:35:11	jhartigan	alright well that record was destroyed
2013-09-17 16:35:17	jhartigan	until that propigates upstream
2013-09-17 16:35:23	jhartigan	we cant really test the www. one
2013-09-17 16:35:42	kweaver_laptop	thats fine
2013-09-17 16:48:53	kweaver_laptop	any luck jhartigan ?
2013-09-17 16:49:00	kweaver_laptop	its still doing the same for me
2013-09-17 16:50:11	jhartigan	mines still dropping www. as well
2013-09-17 16:50:28	jhartigan	only been 15 but i would hope it would have went upstream
2013-09-17 17:00:07	jhartigan	man i followed everything i saw online to a t
2013-09-17 17:00:15	jhartigan	dunno why the new domains not resolving
2013-09-17 17:05:21	kweaver_laptop	bleh
2013-09-17 17:06:18	jhartigan	yeah i dunno
2013-09-17 17:06:37	jhartigan	it could be now a combination of the new configs trickling up to top level shit and local caching
2013-09-17 17:06:46	jhartigan	this is such a shit problem to have
2013-09-17 17:06:48	kweaver_laptop	yeah
2013-09-17 17:06:58	kweaver_laptop	it takes 20 minutes anytime you want to see if it worked

2013-09-20 11:44:34	kweaver	theres also some neat features like team share where I guess you can share juice ssh sessions on other devices
2013-09-20 11:45:00	kweaver	thatd be kinda neat to check out sharing between the phone and tablet
2013-09-20 11:48:27	jhartigan	yeah i saw that on there

2013-09-20 12:46:30	jharty	thats cool
2013-09-20 12:46:35	jharty	should we do write offs instead?
2013-09-20 12:46:37	jharty	or nah
2013-09-20 12:46:43	jharty	cause we could always agree that its 10 hours
2013-09-20 12:46:51	jharty	and get 600 + 300 in write offs for taxes
2013-09-20 12:47:02	jharty	kweaver: im gonna leave to drop this off for amanda soo

2013-09-20 12:51:20	jharty	i mean if you want. maybe call her back and tell her you have an idea that could work for both of us
2013-09-20 12:51:32	jharty	even if next year its free hosting and 500 in writeoffs
2013-09-20 12:51:36	jharty	its still writeoffs i guess

2013-09-20 12:52:19	jharty	Freelance professionals often have non-profits and charities as clients. Oftentimes the freelancer will agree to work for free because they believe in the work the non-profit is doing and want to cut them a break on their fees. So the question naturally arises, "Is freelance work done for charity deductible?" (This interesting question was sent to me by a reader via twitter.)
2013-09-20 12:52:22	jharty	The short answer is no
2013-09-20 12:52:23	jharty	maybe not

2013-10-01 10:50:20	kweaver	I was gonna call brian today and ask about kings custom clothiers

2013-10-01 10:52:27	kweaver	so I quoted $3000, she asked tim and brian if we could do $1500, I sent her a new quote with $1500, and a few less pages, she responded asking if "the site will still remain a $3000 value" and asked for a few of the pages to be put back in the scope
2013-10-01 10:52:29	kweaver	lololol
2013-10-01 10:52:49	kweaver	russo is on my list of reachouts, his last response was that they got really busy and he'd reach out soon

2013-10-01 12:15:24	jhartigan	it was a pretty shitty logo but i guess my recreation of shit was pretty stellar
2013-10-01 13:07:36	kweaver	jhartigan: I dont think casa is happening

2013-10-01 13:11:57	jhartigan	im working on some lunch at the moment.  whats good in the hood
2013-10-01 13:12:27	kweaver	just trying to figure out where we will be when Im done the photoshop work
2013-10-01 13:12:32	kweaver	hows everything on the drupal end?
2013-10-01 13:13:04	jhartigan	durpals installed and theres a sub theme
2013-10-01 13:13:06	jhartigan	its been that way
2013-10-01 13:13:11	kweaver	whats the parent theme?
2013-10-01 13:13:28	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon one
2013-10-01 13:13:42	jhartigan	which is sass/bouron of drupal default
2013-10-01 13:14:23	kweaver	did you add those to the default theme, or was there one you downloaded?
2013-10-01 13:14:32	jhartigan	hm?
2013-10-01 13:15:04	kweaver	did you just download sass/bourbon and use the default theme?
2013-10-01 13:15:11	kweaver	or was there a prepacked one you downloaded
2013-10-01 13:15:14	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon module comes with a theme which is default but preprocesses
2013-10-01 13:15:45	kweaver	ok, so its a seperate theme than the default one that comes with drupal
2013-10-01 13:15:47	kweaver	thats fine
2013-10-01 13:15:54	kweaver	you can deactivate the default drupal theme
2013-10-01 13:15:58	kweaver	we wont be using that at all
2013-10-01 13:16:45	kweaver	what's your next step then after lunch?
2013-10-01 13:16:57	kweaver	im going to assume that the remaining psd shit is going to at least take another day
2013-10-01 13:17:14	kweaver	and tomorrow is bc fun day
2013-10-01 13:17:36	jhartigan	oh shit thats right you have that css shit to do

2013-10-02 10:37:56	jhartigan	yo that cron job seems to be kicking ass and taking names on the server
2013-10-02 10:38:13	jhartigan	ii learned that cache is a bunch of shit. like moved files and stuff
2013-10-02 10:38:17	jhartigan	db entries im sure
2013-10-02 11:45:09	kweaver_laptop	nice jhartigan 
2013-10-02 11:45:26	kweaver_laptop	what ram usage have we been averaging?
2013-10-02 11:45:43	jhartigan	the only thing is.. im hearin you shouldnt need to use it. and essentially youre putting pressure onto the cpu
2013-10-02 11:45:57	jhartigan	like 1200 free has been the highest use ive seen since
2013-10-02 11:46:30	jhartigan	im wondering if theres a swappiness setting i should look at to aleviate it without clearing cache... although its not liek we touch our cpu power
2013-10-02 11:47:52	kweaver_laptop	yeah I dont imagine a custom cron job is that most ideal or average way that people handle it
2013-10-02 11:48:01	kweaver_laptop	but its a start until we find out what that is
2013-10-02 11:49:16	jhartigan	yeah its just odd cause ive never had the problem with anything before
2013-10-02 11:49:22	jhartigan	i think its actually a swappiness setting
2013-10-02 11:49:30	jhartigan	which dictates when to throw shit into the cahce
2013-10-02 11:49:32	jhartigan	cache*
2013-10-02 12:20:01	jhartigan	testing something thats a supposed proper fix for the server

2013-10-09 14:21:23	kweaver	AJPGTUSATVFS3L5TC7A4GGOWCHOIGYP4T
2013-10-09 14:21:25	kweaver	so you dont have to find it

2013-10-09 14:22:15	jhartigan	birdlady and steamicon?
2013-10-09 14:22:20	kweaver	yup
2013-10-09 14:22:32	kweaver	once we have raspberry guy pulling website backups, we should have him take backups of bitsync
2013-10-09 14:22:35	jhartigan	got them instantly on openeing my ac
2013-10-09 14:22:38	kweaver	in case anything happens
2013-10-09 14:22:51	jhartigan	what do you mean
2013-10-09 14:24:25	kweaver	basically just copy the entire bitsync folder, maybe once a week or so, save the last 5 or something
2013-10-09 14:24:40	jhartigan	yeah,. but we were just gonna host it on the pi
2013-10-09 14:24:47	jhartigan	so the pi always has a btsync serve
2013-10-09 14:24:53	jhartigan	and then we always get the files / changes
2013-10-09 14:25:00	jhartigan	so wouldnt that be better haha?
2013-10-09 14:25:02	jhartigan	also
2013-10-09 14:25:06	jhartigan	this shits fucking fast and awesome
2013-10-09 14:25:12	jhartigan	i just set up the secret on my desktop
2013-10-09 14:25:19	kweaver	yeah we would do that also, but copying it  would give us backups
2013-10-09 14:25:23	jhartigan	and its like OHMYGODTHERESFIELSTOGET
2013-10-09 14:25:39	kweaver	just fallbacks
2013-10-09 14:25:56	jhartigan	im not following you at all
2013-10-09 14:26:03	jhartigan	they are synced on different machines
2013-10-09 14:26:06	jhartigan	what are you backing up
2013-10-09 14:26:30	kweaver	our bitsync folder is going to become our everything in the world resources folder
2013-10-09 14:26:33	kweaver	with every psd
2013-10-09 14:26:43	kweaver	every website resource
2013-10-09 14:26:46	kweaver	every font
2013-10-09 14:26:48	kweaver	that we will ever use
2013-10-09 14:27:14	kweaver	Im suggesting that we create backups of that
2013-10-09 14:27:32	jhartigan	but youre suggessting backups of massive files that are not stored on 4 different machines
2013-10-09 14:27:32	kweaver	in case someone rm-r 's by accident and we lose everything we've ever done
2013-10-09 14:27:47	kweaver	4 different machines that are synced together
2013-10-09 14:27:47	jhartigan	deleted files go into .syncarchive
2013-10-09 14:27:53	jhartigan	so they dont go anywhere
2013-10-09 14:28:30	kweaver	so delete a file on a computer wont reflect the deletion on any other?
2013-10-09 14:28:34	kweaver	deleting**
2013-10-09 14:29:33	kweaver	oh damn okay
2013-10-09 14:29:36	jhartigan	unless you just got my deletions nope
2013-10-09 14:29:58	jhartigan	its in the archive now
2013-10-09 14:30:05	jhartigan	its a pretty cool service
2013-10-09 14:30:13	jhartigan	basically deleting it.. moves it out of sync for everyone
2013-10-09 14:30:15	jhartigan	but they keep it
2013-10-09 14:30:21	jhartigan	its actually badass as all hell
2013-10-09 14:31:04	kweaver	damnnn thats cool
2013-10-09 14:31:08	kweaver	yeah I didnt know it did that
2013-10-09 14:31:56	kweaver	if anything, there may still be reason enough for at least one backup, especially if we're tied to a 2-4TB hdd
2013-10-09 14:32:47	kweaver	there have been at least 2 times in my career where I've gone to save something, and accidently saved it over another file
2013-10-09 14:32:54	kweaver	i just did it last week with our omni site
2013-10-09 14:33:16	kweaver	saved fullsite.psd over graphic-design.psd by accident
2013-10-09 14:33:20	kweaver	and then its beat street
2013-10-09 14:33:58	jhartigan	probably best to use a workflow like project/workspace for all psds and then project/exports
2013-10-09 14:34:52	kweaver	what would exports be?
2013-10-09 14:35:32	jhartigan	actual images
2013-10-09 14:35:45	jhartigan	i mean saving overshit its always a danger
2013-10-09 14:35:57	jhartigan	a single weeklong backup probably doesnt prevent that
2013-10-09 14:36:31	kweaver	well we can decide what sort of backups we want to make depending on how much space we've got to work with
2013-10-09 14:36:59	kweaver	ill drop a little extra if it means no worries
2013-10-09 14:37:03	jhartigan	yeah thats not a problem.  its just one pi backing up massive psds
2013-10-09 14:37:12	jhartigan	isnt gonna be the same as getting compressed images and text
2013-10-09 14:37:20	kweaver	I think mazz said his office has a shit load of backups
2013-10-09 14:38:21	jhartigan	im sure they do
2013-10-09 14:39:15	kweaver	alright jhartigan, you might want to turn off bitsync notifications
2013-10-09 14:39:20	kweaver	im gonna start reorganizing everything
2013-10-09 14:39:43	jhartigan	they also dont run them over a pi.  im sure it can handle it, but depending on the backup schedule that folder is gonna shit the bed for the pi
2013-10-09 14:39:49	jhartigan	haha are they obnoxious?
2013-10-09 14:40:03	jhartigan	they arent bad on my mac?
2013-10-09 14:40:08	jhartigan	that wasnt a question hah
2013-10-09 14:40:09	kweaver	not sure, I just know ive got 23k files in box now
2013-10-09 14:40:23	kweaver	i dont think I have them turned on here
2013-10-09 14:40:25	kweaver	ill find out
2013-10-09 14:40:34	jhartigan	structure it how you see fit and well see what happens over here
2013-10-09 14:43:06	kweaver	hmmmm
2013-10-09 14:43:57	kweaver	let me sit/shit on it
2013-10-09 14:44:13	jhartigan	thats gross!
2013-10-09 15:33:26	jhartigan	the menus working. i think ittll look good as a sticky one and is a good break from the parallax should someone scroll past its current location
2013-10-09 15:33:35	jhartigan	so pooryly worded
2013-10-09 15:33:37	jhartigan	back to the top
2013-10-09 15:57:39	kweaver	sweet jhartigan
2013-10-09 15:57:57	kweaver	Im organizing this stuff locally, then I'll move it all into bitsync last
2013-10-09 15:58:10	jhartigan	yeah thats cool
2013-10-09 15:58:15	jhartigan	i figured thats best
2013-10-09 15:58:27	jhartigan	btsync is seriously impressive kweaver
2013-10-09 15:58:37	jhartigan	like insanely awesome
2013-10-09 15:58:38	kweaver	jhartigan:  I wonder if things  would poop itself if we nested our local google Drive root directories inside our bitsync folders?
2013-10-09 15:58:59	jhartigan	i wouldnt bother
2013-10-09 15:59:02	jhartigan	thats redundant
2013-10-09 15:59:05	jhartigan	if youre gonna keep it in drive
2013-10-09 15:59:09	jhartigan	its always online/offline
2013-10-09 15:59:44	kweaver	yeah, It doesnt really have to.  it would just be really nice to just consolidate our documents too
2013-10-09 15:59:53	kweaver	thats kinda the last piece of the puzz
2013-10-09 16:00:18	kweaver	might not be worth the headache if things break though
2013-10-09 16:00:52	jhartigan	yeha i mean if you wanna consolidate docs that way. we can export from drive
2013-10-09 16:00:55	jhartigan	into hard files
2013-10-09 16:00:57	jhartigan	and go thatroute
2013-10-09 16:01:02	jhartigan	but drive is good at that
2013-10-09 16:01:11	jhartigan	documents and resources are a lil different i guess

2013-10-14 15:42:20	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  how goes ghost?
2013-10-14 15:47:01	jhartigan	who knows
2013-10-14 15:47:05	jhartigan	being a bit of a pain
2013-10-14 15:48:58	jhartigan	trying a couple differnt things   found one guy who ran it with nginx so im adapting it
2013-10-14 15:49:10	jhartigan	i think the installs fine actually its jut not showing up on that port or something
2013-10-14 16:48:59	kweaver_laptop	would it be worth using nginx as well?
2013-10-14 16:49:08	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I know thats what tom uses
2013-10-14 16:49:13	kweaver_laptop	instead of apache
2013-10-14 16:57:31	jhartigan	nginx is awesome
2013-10-14 16:57:38	jhartigan	its a bit more complicated for php
2013-10-14 16:57:43	jhartigan	but i can figure it out if we wanna do that
2013-10-14 16:58:05	jhartigan	should i use a second server.. set one up tonight? i 1gb jira / omni-blog and demo server?
2013-10-14 16:58:08	jhartigan	dev*
2013-10-14 16:58:15	jhartigan	gonna go feed my dog and take her out

2013-10-14 17:17:10	kweaver_laptop	yeah I think we should always have a second server running for testies
2013-10-14 17:17:31	kweaver_laptop	theres still a lot for us to play with on the server end 
2013-10-14 17:17:35	kweaver_laptop	stuff like nginx
2013-10-14 17:18:24	kweaver_laptop	1 gb jira wouldnt work though, right?

2013-10-17 09:44:12	jhartigan	run that dist upgrade
2013-10-17 10:56:09	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: I got halfway done a single page, general coming soon page  last night
2013-10-17 10:56:23	kweaver_laptop	www.kingscustomclothiers.com
2013-10-17 10:56:30	kweaver_laptop	no images
2013-10-17 10:56:43	kweaver_laptop	and my end goal once it its done is to compile everything down to one file
2013-10-17 10:56:48	kweaver_laptop	index.html
2013-10-17 10:56:55	kweaver_laptop	booom
2013-10-17 10:57:06	jhartigan	i like that alot
2013-10-17 10:57:10	jhartigan	looks really good
2013-10-17 10:57:45	kweaver_laptop	its not done yet, but the rest is pretty low priority so ill get to it another day
2013-10-17 10:58:37	kweaver_laptop	3 main layers,  a radial shadow, a data-png noise and a data-png diagonal line 
2013-10-17 10:58:39	jhartigan	it doesnt really need anything else
2013-10-17 10:59:55	kweaver_laptop	well, I had an interesting concept for it
2013-10-17 11:00:10	kweaver_laptop	that was sort of the whole point to it
2013-10-17 11:00:16	kweaver_laptop	but ill do that another day
2013-10-17 11:33:55	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: loos like I might have 3 calls with new potential clients today
2013-10-17 11:34:32	kweaver_laptop	before I do that thoguh, Im going to take the notes I have from the business interaction model videos and turn them into a super in depth list of straight forward questions
2013-10-17 11:35:12	kweaver_laptop	then once our drupal site is done, I figure we should just turn it into a webform in a secret url of our site
2013-10-17 11:35:19	jhartigan	thats awesome.. who we got other than the dentist?
2013-10-17 11:35:24	jhartigan	wat?
2013-10-17 11:35:38	kweaver_laptop	tony from bc has 2
2013-10-17 11:35:58	kweaver_laptop	wat?
2013-10-17 11:36:11	jhartigan	whered drupal come back from
2013-10-17 11:36:17	jhartigan	am i stopping node then?
2013-10-17 11:36:22	jhartigan	node/ghost*
2013-10-17 11:37:01	kweaver_laptop	ohhhhhh I was pretty sure we were on different pages before when we talked about it
2013-10-17 11:37:14	kweaver_laptop	i was under the impression that you wanted to have drupal for the main site
2013-10-17 11:37:21	kweaver_laptop	and then /blog would go to a ghost install
2013-10-17 11:37:30	jhartigan	lol
2013-10-17 11:37:34	jhartigan	why would we do that haha
2013-10-17 11:37:50	kweaver_laptop	for drupal practice and and functionality
2013-10-17 11:37:56	kweaver_laptop	and for ghost " " "
2013-10-17 11:38:02	jhartigan	i mean drupal isnt just a blog sure, but using a cms to not handle content would be odd
2013-10-17 11:38:18	jhartigan	yeah and it spending less time on shit that we could also practice on and make money with
2013-10-17 11:38:34	kweaver_laptop	were you thinking just a static site then?  with /blog as a ghost install?
2013-10-17 11:38:40	kweaver_laptop	or create an entire ghost theme
2013-10-17 11:38:52	jhartigan	yeah given thats what i had said. i didnt realize at all you still wanted drupal
2013-10-17 11:39:44	kweaver_laptop	lol I remember asking in the BC parking lot if you were just planning on doing everything in ghost then, and you were like "nooo dude, just the blog part of it"
2013-10-17 11:40:09	jhartigan	yeah
2013-10-17 11:40:45	kweaver_laptop	my impression was that we should eventually have a setup similar to tom and matts site.  we'd have a portfolio section with creatable portfolio items
2013-10-17 11:40:47	jhartigan	cause when i asked i said "we can go drupal or do a static site and try out ghost"
2013-10-17 11:40:55	jhartigan	i dont care
2013-10-17 11:40:58	jhartigan	we can do that
2013-10-17 11:41:00	kweaver_laptop	I dont care either
2013-10-17 11:41:01	kweaver_laptop	haha
2013-10-17 11:41:10	jhartigan	but were gonna extend our work over three weeks without any focus on cash
2013-10-17 11:41:17	jhartigan	thats not smart when we have cash options
2013-10-17 11:41:33	jhartigan	and im all for getting shit in line for the business end of things
2013-10-17 11:41:44	jhartigan	but theres no reason to run ghost blog and drupal
2013-10-17 11:41:47	jhartigan	well just use drupal
2013-10-17 11:42:56	kweaver_laptop	I figured once we had a static site, the rest of the theming, portfolio building, blogging, and any other functionality could be back burnered behind getting cash
2013-10-17 11:43:15	kweaver_laptop	so whether that is drupal or ghost, it doesnt matter too much to me
2013-10-17 11:43:19	kweaver_laptop	wed learn shit either way
2013-10-17 11:43:28	kweaver_laptop	drupal might be a more profitable learning
2013-10-17 11:43:31	jhartigan	i mean sure but then youre building a car
2013-10-17 11:43:35	jhartigan	and turning it into a plane
2013-10-17 11:43:39	jhartigan	instead of building a plane
2013-10-17 11:43:51	kweaver_laptop	how so?
2013-10-17 11:44:02	jhartigan	static site with ghost blog, which we wont use
2013-10-17 11:44:06	jhartigan	turned into a drupal site
2013-10-17 11:44:13	jhartigan	with whole a theme
2013-10-17 11:44:17	jhartigan	and another blog
2013-10-17 11:44:44	kweaver_laptop	ah gotcha
2013-10-17 11:44:49	kweaver_laptop	alright well lets think mvp
2013-10-17 11:45:15	kweaver_laptop	after I write up this list, im 100% just going to finish this paralax and get the static site done
2013-10-17 11:45:40	kweaver_laptop	if the ghost install is going to take more than 10 minutes, then ill leave it up to you if you think its worth it
2013-10-17 11:45:55	kweaver_laptop	i just thought it would be a 10 minute install that we could tinker with and see if we like it
2013-10-17 11:46:03	kweaver_laptop	if its causing problems, then its up to you
2013-10-17 11:46:03	jhartigan	its well over 10min
2013-10-17 11:46:15	jhartigan	i already did a partial on our server and it took 40
2013-10-17 11:46:27	jhartigan	thats why im confused
2013-10-17 11:46:34	jhartigan	i just want to know what were committing to
2013-10-17 11:46:43	jhartigan	switching between ghost and drupal is a waste of time
2013-10-17 11:47:16	jhartigan	and server resources since ghost requires a nodejs server running. which isnt a ton of overhead
2013-10-17 11:47:24	jhartigan	but something to consider nonetheless i suppose
2013-10-17 11:47:52	kweaver_laptop	damn, didnt know that
2013-10-17 11:48:03	jhartigan	yeah its built on node
2013-10-17 11:48:11	jhartigan	so you run a cron node server to keep her running
2013-10-17 11:48:11	kweaver_laptop	alright well if we are thinking in terms of our greatest potential end goal
2013-10-17 11:48:24	kweaver_laptop	i would say we just stick to drupal
2013-10-17 11:48:26	jhartigan	uses sqlite3 for the db by default
2013-10-17 11:48:44	kweaver_laptop	and install ghost on a test site just to learn and see if we like it
2013-10-17 11:49:07	kweaver_laptop	but not anytime soon
2013-10-17 11:50:46	kweaver_laptop	my priority list is this:  1.  build static site   2. build some sort of cms to attach to it    3. do a few more client projects to money  4. add functionality (portfolio, blog etc)
2013-10-17 11:51:10	kweaver_laptop	thoughts?
2013-10-17 11:51:15	jhartigan	alrighty sounds good to me
2013-10-17 11:51:52	kweaver_laptop	alright cool
2013-10-17 11:51:58	kweaver_laptop	I keep getting tweets from lingotek
2013-10-17 11:52:01	kweaver_laptop	and I dont care aboutthem
2013-10-17 11:52:06	jhartigan	unfollow
2013-10-17 11:52:15	jhartigan	all i wanted was your tshirt and your nexus

2013-10-17 11:52:38	kweaver_laptop	pshhh
2013-10-17 11:52:46	kweaver_laptop	youre wrong lingotek
2013-10-17 11:52:52	jhartigan	are they DMs?
2013-10-17 11:53:11	kweaver_laptop	district managers?
2013-10-17 11:53:18	jhartigan	direct messages haha
2013-10-17 11:53:23	kweaver_laptop	oh haha
2013-10-17 11:53:24	kweaver_laptop	nah
2013-10-17 11:53:31	kweaver_laptop	but I had them on notifications
2013-10-17 11:53:37	jhartigan	oh
2013-10-17 11:53:37	kweaver_laptop	in hopes of a nexus 7
2013-10-17 11:53:40	jhartigan	for the nexus
2013-10-17 11:53:42	jhartigan	gotchu
2013-10-17 11:54:22	jhartigan	yo also. i was thinkin about the logo.  for readability sake on cards and shit. what if we took and used a really clean and thin font like google uses for the word nexus and use the same for colors
2013-10-17 11:54:22	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  you still down for going out for melissas bday tomorrow?
2013-10-17 11:55:05	jhartigan	uh probably. where too?  i just dropped nearly a 1k on loans and CC
2013-10-17 11:55:17	kweaver_laptop	yeah thats an option,  once Im done the parallax, I planned on going back and doing like 3 variations of the logo
2013-10-17 11:55:27	kweaver_laptop	oh jam, yeah ill find out
2013-10-17 11:55:32	kweaver_laptop	i think it might be philly though :/
2013-10-17 11:55:46	jhartigan	yeah cause i really like the ribbon look whith that render, but i worry about it on cards and shit
2013-10-17 11:55:48	kweaver_laptop	if you cant its no bigs either
2013-10-17 11:55:57	jhartigan	yeah. it just depends on where i guess
2013-10-17 11:55:57	kweaver_laptop	yeah me too
2013-10-17 11:56:04	kweaver_laptop	I like having two discussions at once
2013-10-17 11:56:08	kweaver_laptop	its efficient
2013-10-17 11:56:19	jhartigan	i  just dont wanna barhoop to 3 places all with covers and shit
2013-10-17 11:56:24	jhartigan	haha so true
2013-10-17 11:56:39	jhartigan	i was gonna do a quick mockup for you
2013-10-17 11:56:52	jhartigan	but googling google nexus font yieled me with droid sans
2013-10-17 11:56:58	kweaver_laptop	yeah I like the ribbon two, but I cant justify putting that implementation of it on a card if I have to worry that people cant read it
2013-10-17 11:57:05	jhartigan	yeah i had the AC bill to cover and then the union tix
2013-10-17 11:57:12	jhartigan	so my CC was higher than usual
2013-10-17 11:57:27	kweaver_laptop	Ill try a couple variations of it
2013-10-17 11:57:28	jhartigan	yeah exactly. oh i made us an omni reddit
2013-10-17 11:57:41	jhartigan	every monrning i troll for hire and craigslist now
2013-10-17 11:57:48	kweaver_laptop	yeah I saw in the jira
2013-10-17 11:58:01	kweaver_laptop	I want to see if I can set notifications in the jira app
2013-10-17 11:58:04	jhartigan	oh true.. forgot im trying to use that shit and be all organized
2013-10-17 11:58:43	kweaver_laptop	I think one thing that will be make us use jira more is some sort of unobtrusive notifications when we do stuff
2013-10-17 11:58:49	kweaver_laptop	emails might clutter up the inbox
2013-10-17 11:59:06	jhartigan	yeah i already filtered and skipped inbox
2013-10-17 11:59:08	jhartigan	lol
2013-10-17 11:59:49	kweaver_laptop	nah the app doesnt offer notifications
2013-10-17 11:59:51	kweaver_laptop	thats silly
2013-10-17 11:59:58	jhartigan	maybe for 5/month
2013-10-17 12:00:00	jhartigan	lolol
2013-10-17 12:00:02	kweaver_laptop	probably
2013-10-17 12:00:03	jhartigan	or two
2013-10-17 12:00:06	jhartigan	or whatever it was
2013-10-17 12:00:10	jhartigan	fucking silly aass app
2013-10-17 12:00:23	kweaver_laptop	all I need to know is that you want to charge memore than the service itself
2013-10-17 12:00:26	jhartigan	android aint there yet.. especially if youre selling something that accesses someone elses product
2013-10-17 12:00:27	kweaver_laptop	and im out

2013-10-17 12:02:48	kweaver_laptop	I think its probably good that the gmail is in all caps
2013-10-17 12:02:56	kweaver_laptop	just to keep it different than every site we sign up on
2013-10-17 12:03:02	kweaver_laptop	that was my plan

2013-10-17 14:03:32	kweaver_laptop	I would so much rather be editting all my docs in vim
2013-10-17 14:03:45	jhartigan	looks old and unupdated though
2013-10-17 14:03:49	jhartigan	anything on github?

2013-10-17 14:07:29	kweaver_laptop	dont see anything
2013-10-17 14:07:44	jhartigan	might be api change limitations
2013-10-17 14:10:25	kweaver_laptop	just installed it 
2013-10-17 14:10:43	kweaver_laptop	trying everything out
2013-10-17 14:10:55	kweaver_laptop	google calendar list to see all calendar events works
2013-10-17 14:13:12	kweaver_laptop	setting up docs now

2013-10-17 14:24:52	kweaver_laptop	still messing with the config to set vim as the default editor
2013-10-17 14:25:01	kweaver_laptop	it looks like it should work fine though
2013-10-17 14:29:38	kweaver_laptop	awwww yeah

2013-10-17 14:30:08	jhartigan	does it edit the web doc or local?
2013-10-17 14:30:34	kweaver_laptop	pretty sweet too, you set which program you want for each type of file.  libre for excel docs etc
2013-10-17 14:31:21	kweaver_laptop	looks like it saves a local version, and then writes up the server version on save
2013-10-17 14:31:29	kweaver_laptop	so you wouldnt want to have someone else in there too
2013-10-17 14:31:48	jhartigan	yeah
2013-10-17 14:31:51	jhartigan	if only covim worked
2013-10-17 14:32:11	kweaver_laptop	yeah we should eventually look into that again.  or some variation

2013-10-17 15:46:34	kweaver_laptop	yeah theres like a 50% chance that it throws an error and wont save to docs
2013-10-17 15:46:54	kweaver_laptop	itll save locally though, so I can just try again and copy it over
2013-10-17 15:47:00	kweaver_laptop	but thats still pretty shitty
2013-10-17 15:47:11	kweaver_laptop	googled the error and they said to updated to the newest version

2013-10-17 16:52:06	kweaver_laptop	yeah im pretty sure the whole docs -> drive movement was within the last year
2013-10-17 16:52:12	kweaver_laptop	that brought about some major change

2013-10-18 10:18:37	kweaver_laptop	lol @ dyrkro.  "tom look how drunk I was!  I dont even remember writing that!"
2013-10-18 10:20:40	jhartigan	i thought it wouldve been something halfway relevant... like "ask tommyvo how to make this work"
2013-10-18 10:22:49	kweaver_laptop	https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=192557
2013-10-18 10:25:04	kweaver_laptop	confluence seems to integrate pretty well with jira
2013-10-18 10:25:13	kweaver_laptop	and its costs $10....
2013-10-18 10:25:14	kweaver_laptop	total
2013-10-18 10:26:27	kweaver_laptop	it seems to be more in the realm of the project management and customer relationship manangement realm
2013-10-18 10:26:46	jhartigan	fuck i like that it offers fuckin templates that will sit there and you can edit and save
2013-10-18 10:26:51	jhartigan	docs makes that a hassle
2013-10-18 10:27:32	kweaver_laptop	yeahhhh docs probably shouldnt be used the way we use them
2013-10-18 10:27:32	kweaver_laptop	lol
2013-10-18 10:27:42	kweaver_laptop	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJEK6lh_cvk#t=51
2013-10-18 10:27:48	jhartigan	yeah i mean maybe not
2013-10-18 10:28:07	jhartigan	but the template document idea seems like something google would strive for, given its share oriented feature
2013-10-18 10:28:24	kweaver_laptop	damn you atlassian
2013-10-18 10:30:06	kweaver_laptop	so far ive made a point out of checking/updating jira everymorning

2013-10-18 10:31:11	jhartigan	i tend to leave it open in a tab
2013-10-18 10:31:23	kweaver_laptop	shit, youre right

2013-10-18 10:33:37	jhartigan	confluence does look pretty sick
2013-10-18 10:34:32	kweaver_laptop	you should nab it
2013-10-18 10:34:43	kweaver_laptop	even if we decided we didnt like it..... it's $10
2013-10-18 10:34:49	jhartigan	yeah

2013-10-18 10:34:59	jhartigan	assuming itll run alongside jira
2013-10-18 10:35:07	jhartigan	they both shouldnt need 1g to idle
2013-10-18 10:36:13	jhartigan	ill just get it with calendars

2013-10-22 15:40:48	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: 
2013-10-22 15:41:19	jhartigan	yoyo
2013-10-22 15:41:19	kweaver_laptop	just spent the last half hour exporting the stylings of the testimonials widget from flanders catering for brian flaim
2013-10-22 15:41:34	kweaver_laptop	he said he wants their testimonials page with that look
2013-10-22 15:41:56	kweaver_laptop	but then I realized that elegant themes has all of their shortcodes in a plugin
2013-10-22 15:42:04	kweaver_laptop	lolol
2013-10-22 15:42:33	jhartigan	dudnt you have to tweak it a little bit?
2013-10-22 15:43:30	kweaver_laptop	the other plugin I used was their page editor one
2013-10-22 15:43:32	kweaver_laptop	that one broke
2013-10-22 15:43:33	kweaver_laptop	all the time
2013-10-22 15:44:54	kweaver_laptop	anyway I have it installed on BC's site now, but having an issue with the image on each testimonial 
2013-10-22 15:44:58	kweaver_laptop	seems to break the world
2013-10-22 15:45:09	kweaver_laptop	wondering if you wanted to look at too
2013-10-22 15:46:40	kweaver_laptop	I also emailed jhanna her round 2 logos
2013-10-22 15:46:41	kweaver_laptop	http://imgur.com/a/NC9eK
2013-10-22 15:47:07	jhartigan	i can loook at it as well. just for like 15 min
2013-10-22 15:47:12	jhartigan	then i gotta get ready and meet rob
2013-10-22 15:47:20	jhartigan	me him matt n your bro goin to see pearl jame
2013-10-22 15:47:23	jhartigan	jam
2013-10-22 15:47:27	jhartigan	i know youre so jelly
2013-10-22 15:49:24	jhartigan	also are we keeping ultrasonic soap
2013-10-22 15:49:30	jhartigan	did i ask that earlier?
2013-10-22 15:49:42	kweaver_laptop	yeah keep it
2013-10-22 15:49:54	kweaver_laptop	my dads weird and likes to keep sites from 1998
2013-10-22 15:51:27	jhartigan	haha thats cool. its just a mess of a directory stucture
2013-10-22 15:51:35	jhartigan	i had started trying to separate it
2013-10-22 15:51:39	jhartigan	and then i thought better of it
2013-10-22 16:00:41	kweaver_laptop	yeah
2013-10-22 16:03:52	jhartigan	so is the issue on the live page on bc?
2013-10-22 16:04:13	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  dunno if this helps at all https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-configure-and-maintain-ghost-from-the-command-line
2013-10-22 16:04:27	kweaver_laptop	digital ocean is pretty sweet with their walkthroughs
2013-10-22 16:04:41	kweaver_laptop	my issue is this jhartigan  http://bctechnologies.biz/test-testimonials/
2013-10-22 16:04:57	jhartigan	what about ghost nowww
2013-10-22 16:05:00	jhartigan	haha
2013-10-22 16:05:32	jhartigan	is there nothing on the page or did my browser shit the bed?
2013-10-22 16:05:49	kweaver_laptop	go into edit that page
2013-10-22 16:06:00	kweaver_laptop	and youll see its just a shortcode for a testimonial
2013-10-22 16:06:23	kweaver_laptop	if you delete the image link in the testimonial, the page will render fine
2013-10-22 16:08:42	jhartigan	probably cause this isnt et
2013-10-22 16:08:52	jhartigan	wasnt this a separate theme?
2013-10-22 16:10:17	kweaver_laptop	yeah, but the concept of the et-shortcodes theme is to be used any non et-theme.  those shortcodes come with every et-theme with no need for the plugin
2013-10-22 16:10:29	kweaver_laptop	and the shortcode clearly works if you remove the image
2013-10-22 16:10:37	kweaver_laptop	well ill keep looking into it
2013-10-22 16:10:59	jhartigan	yeah but they suck
2013-10-22 16:11:00	kweaver_laptop	you can get ready for your jams
2013-10-22 16:11:02	jhartigan	and this wp is updated
2013-10-22 16:11:05	jhartigan	i got a few
2013-10-22 16:11:09	jhartigan	ill keep lookin at it
2013-10-22 16:11:20	jhartigan	maybe its something to do with the new WP / jquery update
2013-10-22 16:12:39	jhartigan	whats weird is it interferes with mad css
2013-10-22 16:12:44	jhartigan	the entire nav bar doesnt render and shit
2013-10-22 16:12:49	jhartigan	WP nav bar
2013-10-22 16:15:34	jhartigan	mad errors showing up in shortcodes css
2013-10-22 16:16:20	kweaver_laptop	k keep a window open with it broken, im gonna set it without an image to compare
2013-10-22 16:16:45	jhartigan	i did

2013-10-22 16:16:53	jhartigan	nevermind
2013-10-22 16:16:58	jhartigan	false hopes
2013-10-22 16:17:20	jhartigan	but flanders testimonials does not have those errors
2013-10-22 16:18:11	kweaver_laptop	there are two shortcodes.css
2013-10-22 16:18:22	kweaver_laptop	the one with the warnings is the one that came with the theme
2013-10-22 16:18:33	kweaver_laptop	the one with no warnings is the et one

2013-10-28 11:57:11	jhartigan	yeah thats weird that caused the issue. i figure its got something todo with actually processing the embedded image
2013-10-28 11:57:15	jhartigan	or attempting to render it
2013-10-28 11:58:52	kweaver	yeah im thinking it was probably a buffer overload.  I had two data-png urls in there, the first one wasnt too long and was fine, the second was probably a few hundred KB all in one line

2013-11-04 15:39:50	jhartigan	just figured it should look like a quick super fix instead of 25min later
2013-11-04 15:40:00	jhartigan	anyways you see what i said above about joomla?
2013-11-04 15:40:08	jhartigan	and daves gig seems pretty simple/straightforward

2013-11-04 15:47:59	jhartigan	daves requirements are def odd. itll get semi strict.. tomorrow we should sit down and figure out what we would charge for this

2013-11-04 15:51:51	kweaver	you can reply to that last email then, and say there might have been some confusion with Dr. Holdbrook while Nancy was on the phone
2013-11-04 15:51:58	kweaver	and then they dont use smarsh

2013-11-04 15:55:43	kweaver	yeah just ask her to get together any info she might have on the email provider that they use
2013-11-04 15:59:02	jhartigan	yeah but what you think about joomla
2013-11-04 15:59:07	jhartigan	i think we need ftp access
2013-11-04 16:03:37	jhartigan	josh terrifies me.. he scares me so much that i feel terrible about leaving you with the heroes.. ohman
2013-11-04 16:04:10	kweaver	oh dont worry about that.  Im not giving him any amount of work on anything that really matters
2013-11-04 16:04:28	kweaver	yeah im looking in the joomla backend
2013-11-04 16:04:43	kweaver	we probably need ftp.  lets just wait til she gets us everything she can
2013-11-04 16:04:45	jhartigan	i feel so mean saying that... but his questions
2013-11-04 16:04:53	kweaver	I dont want to confuse her with more requests
2013-11-04 16:05:00	jhartigan	yeah ive been all over backend. i got file uploads and the mail settings
2013-11-04 16:05:11	jhartigan	but cant find shit that remotely looks like an editor or parts of pages
2013-11-04 16:06:09	kweaver	I know this is an old version of joomla, but im really surprised at how bad this back end is
2013-11-04 16:06:23	jhartigan	yeah its fucking terrible
2013-11-04 16:06:40	jhartigan	i tried to find something remotely developer oriented but i really think this shit is made for like marketers
2013-11-04 16:06:51	jhartigan	its got like 0 dev features
2013-11-04 16:07:05	kweaver	I was expecting more from it considering that some people seem to discuss it like its on the same level as WP  or Drupal
2013-11-04 16:07:42	jhartigan	yeah seriously
2013-11-04 16:07:57	jhartigan	its like everything thats confusing about drupal and everything that doesnt work well in wordpress
2013-11-04 16:07:59	jhartigan	in one
2013-11-04 16:08:12	kweaver	lol yeah

2013-11-04 16:08:36	jhartigan	oh shit where
2013-11-04 16:08:45	kweaver	it looks like the entire site is broken into "articles"
2013-11-04 16:08:51	kweaver	its a fuggin mess
2013-11-04 16:09:58	jhartigan	yeah
2013-11-04 16:10:01	jhartigan	i found that
2013-11-04 16:10:04	kweaver	oh
2013-11-04 16:10:06	jhartigan	but i dont think we ahve access to any css and shit
2013-11-04 16:11:13	kweaver	ohh
2013-11-04 16:11:32	jhartigan	yeah as far as the actual page content it sucks its all in there
2013-11-04 16:11:42	jhartigan	and then theres an entire tab with entirely too many options for menus haha
2013-11-04 16:14:29	kweaver	jhartigan:

2013-11-04 16:14:35	kweaver	2) In the row of menus across the top, go to "site"
2013-11-04 16:14:37	kweaver	3) Choose template manager in the drop down menus
2013-11-04 16:14:39	kweaver	4) Choose Site templates in the menu that slides out to the side
2013-11-04 16:14:41	kweaver	5) When the page loads, put a check mark in the box next to your default template.
2013-11-04 16:14:43	kweaver	6) Click "Edit CSS" in the top right hand corner.
2013-11-04 16:14:45	kweaver	7) Make the changes to your CSS file that you wish to
2013-11-04 16:14:47	kweaver	we dont have Site Templates there
2013-11-04 16:14:54	kweaver	soooo, we probably have a limited permissions account
2013-11-04 16:15:27	jhartigan	template manager is under fucking extensions
2013-11-04 16:15:30	jhartigan	its that old
2013-11-04 16:17:13	jhartigan	i think the dude runs this shit on his own server
2013-11-04 16:17:28	jhartigan	ip is 174.132.30.186
2013-11-04 16:17:49	jhartigan	fucking shits in /home/wendall/public_html

2013-11-07 14:57:12	jhartigan	alright im headed to wawa right quick
2013-11-07 14:57:23	kweaver	k
2013-11-07 15:19:39	kweaver	jhartigan: you see dleonhardt's email?
2013-11-07 15:19:57	kweaver	two projects!
2013-11-07 15:19:59	kweaver	woooo
2013-11-07 15:20:08	jhartigan	yeah
2013-11-07 15:20:11	jhartigan	gotit at wawa
2013-11-07 15:20:14	jhartigan	the second one is cake
2013-11-07 15:20:24	kweaver	yeah definitely
2013-11-07 15:21:04	kweaver	i wanna give him a call later and see if I can get a general concept of their budget
2013-11-07 15:21:25	kweaver	this company seems big enough to have an understanding of what software costs
2013-11-07 15:21:29	kweaver	so im not too worried
2013-11-07 15:29:32	kweaver	the vast majority of project two is the visuals and the graphing
2013-11-07 15:30:02	kweaver	if they want it "identical", it could actually be a bigger project
2013-11-07 15:30:51	jhartigan	yeah it could be
2013-11-07 15:31:16	jhartigan	the math is easy.. and theres def some js/cs libraries for graphs but its definitely a difficult one
2013-11-07 15:31:26	jhartigan	the problem is <2mo for both
2013-11-07 15:31:33	kweaver	yeahhhhh
2013-11-07 15:31:34	jhartigan	whatever cash they have they lose it, so its not about the price
2013-11-07 15:31:43	jhartigan	its about the budget getting reset
2013-11-07 15:31:49	kweaver	we should go over the spec shortly
2013-11-07 15:31:57	kweaver	we might want to bring tom and matt on board
2013-11-07 15:32:26	jhartigan	i mean 4 persons on the two
2013-11-07 15:32:32	jhartigan	im thinking we can get 80/hour easy
2013-11-07 15:32:41	kweaver	yeah definitely
2013-11-07 15:33:14	jhartigan	my best guess would be 2 weeks each per project
2013-11-07 15:33:37	jhartigan	which would give us around 2 weeks of revision time assuming we start after next week
2013-11-07 15:34:27	kweaver	problem is, matt needs to quit his fuckin job
2013-11-07 15:34:36	jhartigan	rough guestimates with four of us on two weeks per project gets us aroud 10k after taxes
2013-11-07 15:34:45	jhartigan	2500/4 weeks isnt bad
2013-11-07 15:34:49	kweaver	because bringing them on board really just means bringing tom on board
2013-11-07 15:35:01	jhartigan	tom gets that more than that from other clients tho
2013-11-07 15:35:40	kweaver	well lemme finish adding a couple initial items into magento
2013-11-07 15:35:41	jhartigan	i mean the JS slider isnt that bad. in terms of technical aspects. a little learning hear and there and some tie ins to the xml shit
2013-11-07 15:35:45	kweaver	i added at the categories
2013-11-07 15:35:58	kweaver	and then ill export
2013-11-07 15:58:49	jhartigan	can you login to dev/BarsugliaOmni/wp-admin  i cant get in with admin barsu312! or barsug312!  been messing with pippet most of the day but remembered i wanted to put  the easy wp smtp on there
2013-11-07 16:08:10	kweaver	is that the url jhartigan ?
2013-11-07 16:08:16	kweaver	its saying not found
2013-11-07 16:08:42	kweaver	nm forgot oms2
2013-11-07 16:10:35	kweaver	just sent a password reset jhartigan
2013-11-07 16:10:38	kweaver	but not getting anything
2013-11-07 16:11:28	kweaver	which makes sense
2013-11-07 16:11:32	kweaver	since we dont have smtp
2013-11-07 16:13:04	jhartigan	we can just do it on the old one
2013-11-07 16:13:11	jhartigan	and use the easy peaze migration
2013-11-07 16:13:20	jhartigan	wget and dump is simple enough
2013-11-07 16:13:28	jhartigan	runnin my dog outdoors
2013-11-07 16:36:43	kweaver	sounds good
2013-11-07 16:36:45	kweaver	eating real quick
2013-11-07 17:01:37	kweaver	jhartigan: how do I get to phpMyAdmin on oms2?
2013-11-07 17:02:53	kweaver	looks like some of the default products that game with this theme are bugged and giving me an error when Im trying to delete them
2013-11-07 17:06:45	jhartigan	there is no php my admin
2013-11-07 17:06:50	jhartigan	never has been
2013-11-07 17:07:39	kweaver	didnt we talk about having that?
2013-11-07 17:07:59	jhartigan	yeah we talked about not having it
2013-11-07 17:08:05	jhartigan	decided we had no need for it
2013-11-07 17:14:34	jhartigan	should be a standard ubuntu package if you need to install it
2013-11-07 17:15:40	kweaver	I think im gonna
2013-11-07 17:15:52	kweaver	only because that database has 341 tables
2013-11-07 17:17:11	jhartigan	you just gotta be careful with users and passwords cause now its facing the web
2013-11-07 17:22:51	kweaver	oms2.omni-dev.com/phpmyadmin
2013-11-07 17:24:07	kweaver	it uses the root user
2013-11-07 17:24:28	kweaver	i dont know if theres a way to use another one
2013-11-07 17:25:04	jhartigan	it uses any user for mysql
2013-11-07 17:25:27	jhartigan	its literally a graphical mysql
2013-11-07 17:25:44	kweaver	oh nm, i got confused when kevin/rowan5018 wasnt working
2013-11-07 17:25:55	kweaver	but i forget I never crreated him as a mysql user
2013-11-07 17:29:23	jhartigan	we should probably disable root login through php my admin
2013-11-07 17:29:46	jhartigan	just use the client db owner and pass as they have full privileges for the account
2013-11-07 17:31:11	kweaver	k
2013-11-07 17:31:16	kweaver	do you know how to disable root?
2013-11-07 17:32:51	kweaver	nm got it
2013-11-07 17:36:05	kweaver	all set
2013-11-07 17:36:21	kweaver	jhartigan, we dont have any other users with root access to mysql, do we?
2013-11-07 17:37:14	jhartigan	nah
2013-11-07 17:37:20	jhartigan	every user has access to their shit
2013-11-07 17:37:30	jhartigan	oh you set the root off
2013-11-07 17:37:34	jhartigan	okay i didnt wanna log you out
2013-11-07 17:37:41	jhartigan	the only user with table access otherwise is backups
2013-11-07 17:37:51	jhartigan	and his is read only to all tables cept information schema and accounts
2013-11-07 17:38:05	jhartigan	but that way theres no web facing account with root available
2013-11-07 17:42:37	kweaver	k
2013-11-07 17:42:56	kweaver	yeah if you try to log in with root now, youll get access denied
2013-11-07 17:59:56	kweaver	so i deleted all the example data jhartigan
2013-11-07 18:00:12	kweaver	Ill upload it to drive and we can work on it tomorrow
2013-11-07 18:17:16	jhartigan	what drive?

2013-11-08 10:35:07	kweaver	yeah
2013-11-08 10:35:25	kweaver	i exported a csv from magento with 3 items in it
2013-11-08 10:35:49	kweaver	there is no east export from cubecart to magento
2013-11-08 10:35:52	kweaver	easy**
2013-11-08 10:36:17	kweaver	theres a $70 extension
2013-11-08 10:36:41	kweaver	and even then, magento has a shit load more fields that need to be populated
2013-11-08 10:38:00	kweaver	so the fastest route for us is to export the 3 items I already have in magento, fill in the rest together via in a google drive spreadsheet, and then import that into magento
2013-11-08 10:44:55	jhartigan	okay i gotcha now. thats where i thought we were for
2013-11-08 10:58:07	jhartigan	imma go grab a coffee. didnt think i needed one but since i dosed in the chair for like 20 minutes it seems like a solid endeavor

2013-11-08 11:24:40	kweaver	jhartigan I was hoping we could at least export to a csv and copy/paste columns into the appropriate places
2013-11-08 11:24:52	kweaver	it doesnt look like cubecart3 even had an export...
2013-11-08 11:35:19	jhartigan	haha it wouldnt surprise me. sorry took the dog out and went to dunkin

2013-11-14 10:47:58	kweaver	jhartigan, dave:"hey man. we're gonna send you a revised copy of the spec pretty soonjust going over it right now"
2013-11-14 10:48:51	jhartigan	I HIT SNOOZE ON PURPOSE SO ID WAKE UP TO BETTER NEWS DAMNIT
2013-11-14 11:14:08	kweaver	jhartigan I can see what theyve been taking so long doing
2013-11-14 11:14:19	kweaver	they changed around like 10 specs
2013-11-14 11:14:26	kweaver	mostly just going in more detail
2013-11-14 11:14:36	jhartigan	oh shit they responded finally
2013-11-14 11:14:46	jhartigan	oh i got the email
2013-11-14 11:14:49	jhartigan	didnt notice
2013-11-14 11:16:07	kweaver	im a little worried about them not caring about the bmi calc
2013-11-14 11:16:36	kweaver	theyve clearly gone all out with the specs, making sure this slideshow will turn out exactly as they want it
2013-11-14 11:16:53	jhartigan	it also doesnt already exist
2013-11-14 11:17:29	jhartigan	oh shit yo
2013-11-14 11:17:32	jhartigan	ie8+
2013-11-14 11:17:35	jhartigan	fucking tits
2013-11-14 11:17:39	kweaver	yesss
2013-11-14 11:18:03	kweaver	nah I know.  but they didnt even feel like writing anything up for the calc, and dave said his boss hasnt talked about the bmi calc at all
2013-11-14 11:18:13	kweaver	im just going to set my expectations low on that one
2013-11-14 11:18:46	jhartigan	yeah. either way its good we got another spec and all that jazz
2013-11-14 11:19:24	kweaver	plus, I could see them being like "well, the one project takes up most of our free budget anyway.  we'll just see how you guys do with it and save the bmi calc for next year"
2013-11-14 11:21:00	jhartigan	yeah thats another possibility
2013-11-14 11:21:07	jhartigan	we have no clue what their budget is currently
2013-11-14 11:21:11	kweaver	yeah
2013-11-14 11:28:43	kweaver	so they use that cross browser app BrowserStack jhartigan
2013-11-14 11:28:45	kweaver	https://www.browserstack.com/pricing
2013-11-14 11:28:45	[url]:	http://tinyurl.com/kc7vegw
2013-11-14 11:28:58	kweaver	they have 5 accounts.....
2013-11-14 11:29:26	kweaver	they spend $240 per month on just making sure their html and css changes look good in safari
2013-11-14 11:29:37	jhartigan	lol
2013-11-14 11:29:43	jhartigan	as opposed to buying a mac?
2013-11-14 11:30:32	kweaver	seriously...
2013-11-14 11:30:42	kweaver	but anyway, they're going to lend us an account
2013-11-14 11:30:52	kweaver	"assuming we move forward"
2013-11-14 11:30:56	kweaver	so tired of assuming
2013-11-14 11:31:07	jhartigan	wtf do they want
2013-11-14 11:31:16	jhartigan	they can have the rights to my first born at this point
2013-11-14 11:32:04	kweaver	well im saving their spec sheet and attaching it to the proposal
2013-11-14 11:32:15	kweaver	so that its all one pdf, just at the end of our stuff
2013-11-14 11:32:37	jhartigan	sounds fine to me
2013-11-14 11:32:47	jhartigan	i didnt notice anything i didnt like in there
2013-11-14 11:43:32	kweaver	sending now
2013-11-14 11:44:33	kweaver	worst case, they have us just do the slider, we knock their socks off with a speedy return, and then we'll have a clear cut next project to start bugging them about in january
2013-11-14 11:45:28	jhartigan	well i dont think we should bug them about their project
2013-11-14 11:45:38	kweaver	you know what I mean though
2013-11-14 11:45:39	jhartigan	they might have had a reason for left over budget this year
2013-11-14 11:45:44	kweaver	im not suggesting we spam them
2013-11-14 11:46:24	kweaver	but that at least gives us a more defined next job, better than "we might have 'future projects' "
2013-11-14 11:46:54	jhartigan	yeah sure
2013-11-14 11:48:42	kweaver	bflaim wants to chat today about picking a new theme for the site to keep things fresh
2013-11-14 11:48:54	kweaver	I dont think he realizes that basically means creating an entire new site
2013-11-14 11:49:11	kweaver	hes probably under the assumption that its plug an play
2013-11-14 11:49:34	jhartigan	what is with them
2013-11-14 11:49:38	kweaver	no idea
2013-11-14 11:49:41	jhartigan	they picked this theme like 3 months ago
2013-11-14 11:49:49	kweaver	pretty sure they just like wasting our time
2013-11-14 11:49:57	kweaver	since they dont know what else to do with us
2013-11-14 11:52:00	jhartigan	yeah shit i guess so
2013-11-14 11:53:03	jhartigan	first its - yo we have these meta as fuck testimonials wed like that completely clash
2013-11-14 11:53:13	jhartigan	no they probably want a new meta theme to add onto the site
2013-11-14 11:53:20	jhartigan	so they meta testimonials fit
2013-11-14 11:54:08	kweaver	Ill explain that its the equivelant of starting over, and that while we've gotten a lot of great new potential clients from them,  the only recent money from their clients has been the $700 from jhanna that we still need to get
2013-11-14 11:55:48	jhartigan	yeah and i mean.. its seriously a 3 month old site... fresh and rushing into a design arent the same thing
2013-11-14 12:01:55	jhartigan	im purty hungry gonna go make some foods

2013-11-18 12:41:48	kweaver	outside
2013-11-18 12:42:04	kweaver	it could have been a truck door slamming or something
2013-11-18 12:42:07	jhartigan	coulda been.
2013-11-18 12:42:13	kweaver	but it was the exact second the power flashed
2013-11-18 12:42:15	jhartigan	maybe a short on a transformer though as well
2013-11-18 12:42:29	jhartigan	yeah we got some nasty wind, i wonder if its related to the midwestern storms

2013-11-18 16:42:00	kweaver1	diggin it
2013-11-18 16:42:16	jhartigan	those are all on google images - supercool 360x240
2013-11-18 16:42:20	jhartigan	cause the supacool
2013-11-18 16:42:38	kweaver1	ill throw their styling on later
2013-11-18 16:43:06	jhartigan	yeah i mean there still alot i have to do to it
2013-11-18 16:43:06	kweaver1	next we should look into options for javascript touch sliding
2013-11-18 16:48:18	kweaver1	jhartigan:  for that I found a couple routes
2013-11-18 16:48:42	kweaver1	1.   a slider with it built in already, http://codecanyon.net/item/mobile-touch-swipe-nojquery-jssor-slider/2797680
2013-11-18 16:48:43	[url]:	http://tinyurl.com/mv43htq
2013-11-18 16:49:00	kweaver1	2. a javascript only touch library https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js/
2013-11-18 16:49:00	[url]:	http://tinyurl.com/b3xtp3k
2013-11-18 16:49:56	jhartigan	does it look good to use a prebuilt library
2013-11-18 16:49:57	jhartigan	im kinda torn on it
2013-11-18 16:50:05	jhartigan	not that we have to advertise it
2013-11-18 16:50:35	kweaver1	library might be overkill
2013-11-18 16:50:44	jhartigan	didnt mean library
2013-11-18 16:50:45	kweaver1	im looking for the article I found about it
2013-11-18 16:50:46	jhartigan	meant slider
2013-11-18 16:50:56	jhartigan	said library cause dumb
2013-11-18 16:50:59	jhartigan	library im fine with
2013-11-18 16:51:39	kweaver1	if anything, I dont mind just looking at a slider, and taking it line by line and pulling what we need
2013-11-18 16:51:47	kweaver1	refactor it
2013-11-18 16:51:56	kweaver1	and make it work with multiple slider etc
2013-11-18 16:52:29	kweaver1	itll be quicker if we are at least basing ours off of another
2013-11-18 16:53:18	kweaver1	if there is one aspect of the internet that has been written from scratch 50,000 times, its a slider

2013-11-21 09:39:04	jhartigan	i already replied
2013-11-21 09:39:40	kweaver	thats what I figured
2013-11-21 09:39:52	kweaver	do you remember if we are actually using the coupon module?
2013-11-21 09:40:20	jhartigan	its enabled
2013-11-21 09:40:21	-->	kweaver1 (~kweaver@96.248.78.50) has joined #omnidev
2013-11-21 09:40:29	jhartigan	thats irrelevant to this issue
2013-11-21 09:40:40	kweaver	nah, but I did just find another issue
2013-11-21 09:40:42	jhartigan	is it? i dunno cause its the kickstart ui not standard drupal commerce
2013-11-21 09:40:52	jhartigan	so i couldnt tell you if its the module or not
2013-11-21 09:41:00	jhartigan	its a guide on the kickstart page
2013-11-21 09:41:08	jhartigan	that was used but thats all i got for you
2013-11-21 09:41:29	kweaver	enter the coupon to add 1, then go back and enter it again to add another
2013-11-21 09:41:35	kweaver	then go back and keep doing it
2013-11-21 09:41:40	kweaver	the coupon percentage stacks
2013-11-21 09:43:28	jhartigan	no it doesnt
2013-11-21 09:43:52	kweaver	nevermind
2013-11-21 09:43:58	jhartigan	it reduces cause he has tiers
2013-11-21 09:43:59	kweaver	its the quantitity discount
2013-11-21 09:44:01	kweaver	yaya
2013-11-21 09:44:06	kweaver	k we good
2013-11-21 09:44:11	jhartigan	yeah it caps at four and shes an idiot
2013-11-21 09:44:17	jhartigan	he is too. so theres that
2013-11-21 09:44:22	jhartigan	also
2013-11-21 09:44:30	jhartigan	you can enter invalid coupons and you dont get an error
2013-11-21 09:44:36	jhartigan	does he have another site somewhere?
2013-11-21 09:44:41	jhartigan	you just dont get a discount
2013-11-21 09:45:40	kweaver	i was just going to say the same thing
2013-11-21 09:46:01	kweaver	yeah I dont know why she thinks it said its invalid
2013-11-21 09:46:06	jhartigan	man i was making a screenshot of a dicpics coupon for you =/
2013-11-21 09:46:21	jhartigan	but i mean whatever happened.. is not on this site
2013-11-21 09:46:31	jhartigan	it may be ugly, but like a good slut, she works fine
2013-11-21 09:57:25	kweaver	just responded
2013-11-21 09:57:31	kweaver	Mark,
2013-11-21 09:57:31	kweaver	   Jake and I tested it with every quantity and 4 computers and every browser so it definitely works.  Also, functionality like that would never be a caching issue either.   She  mentioned " It said it was invalid. " .   The coupon module we used does not come with any validation for wrong coupons by default.  Typing in a wrong coupon will not display any error, it simply will not do anything.
2013-11-21 09:57:42	kweaver	My guess:
2013-11-21 09:57:42	kweaver	1.  She's on the wrong site.
2013-11-21 09:57:42	kweaver	2.  She applied it, it worked, but she looked at the order total after shipping and thought it didn't work. 
2013-11-21 09:58:10	kweaver	its fantastic to see how quickly stupid people have difficulty with very basic tasks
2013-11-21 09:58:30	kweaver	makes you think how many calls a site like amazon gets
2013-11-21 09:58:37	kweaver	for people having trouble doing things
2013-11-21 09:59:23	jhartigan	yeah dude customer service over there must be a shitshow
2013-11-21 09:59:51	kweaver	like literally, he sent that last night
2013-11-21 10:00:06	kweaver	and I told him it worked in the afternoon
2013-11-21 10:00:20	kweaver	there was only a couple hours that people even knew it existed
2013-11-21 10:01:27	jhartigan	yeah i really have no idea what could have happened
2013-11-21 10:01:40	jhartigan	i did some googling, couldnt find anything else she would have been on

2013-11-22 10:43:00	kweaver	ya sec
2013-11-22 10:44:08	kweaver	wat
2013-11-22 10:44:39	jhartigan	i dont know what she means.. im assuming somone with their l33t skills at the office made a "newsletter" in paint
2013-11-22 10:45:01	kweaver	yeah, why is this image illegible just because its a jpeg?
2013-11-22 10:45:09	kweaver	shes obviously just doing computers wrong
2013-11-22 10:45:12	jhartigan	yeah
2013-11-22 10:46:06	kweaver	maybe we should call her?
2013-11-22 10:46:15	kweaver	and just figure out what they want
2013-11-22 10:46:20	jhartigan	im trying to avoid working on their shit today
2013-11-22 10:46:25	jhartigan	other than attempting a form
2013-11-22 10:51:01	kweaver	im writing up a response
2013-11-22 10:51:10	kweaver	do you want to send it, or you want me?
2013-11-22 10:51:18	kweaver	i think the idea is just to have a featured patient page
2013-11-22 10:51:23	jhartigan	oh i was about to send it
2013-11-22 10:51:29	jhartigan	yeah i get that
2013-11-22 10:51:32	kweaver	oh ok
2013-11-22 10:51:43	jhartigan	but im not gonna sit here and do a page and convert a jpeg into an article
2013-11-22 10:51:51	jhartigan	when i have more important shit to do today
2013-11-22 10:51:54	kweaver	yeah I would just recommend that they have us create a featured page, and then simply link to it on their facebook
2013-11-22 10:52:12	kweaver	and then just tell them, if thats the concept they're going for, we can do it next week
2013-11-22 10:56:47	jhartigan	yeah if she asks in a reply illl tell her what time it is
2013-11-22 10:56:57	jhartigan	which means ill tell her send it and well do it next week
2013-11-22 10:57:12	jhartigan	and the way this is going we might wanna start billing them in increments
2013-11-22 10:57:19	jhartigan	cause it looks/seems like they wanna keep doing shit
2013-11-22 10:57:23	jhartigan	could be wrong though
2013-11-22 11:01:59	kweaver	yeah, actually while youre still talking to her.  can you send her another email saying that we will be sending her an invoice this afternoon for everything so far.
2013-11-22 11:02:48	kweaver	just so im not blind siding her with it
2013-11-22 11:03:10	jhartigan	yeah if she doesnt reply within a half hour ill send it out to her

2013-11-22 13:57:01	kweaver	jhartigan, they just want a page made up that they can link to
2013-11-22 13:58:31	kweaver	reply to her email, ask them to send us an example "featured patient" with all the info/pictures they would want on there
2013-11-22 13:58:41	kweaver	and then we will make a page for them next week
2013-11-22 13:58:44	kweaver	that they can link to
2013-11-22 14:01:40	jhartigan	i already did that
2013-11-22 14:01:42	jhartigan	forever ago
2013-11-22 14:01:44	jhartigan	you were ccd
2013-11-22 14:02:00	-->	kweaver1 (~kweaver@96.248.78.50) has joined #omnidev
2013-11-22 14:39:15	kweaver	im kinda pissed at myself for being this disorganized with barsuglia
2013-11-22 14:39:28	kweaver	granted I wasnt expecting a 13 month turn around
2013-11-22 14:39:40	kweaver	but Im still looking for with proposal
2013-11-22 14:39:53	kweaver	and I dont think we even gave them one
2013-11-22 14:39:58	jhartigan	yeah.. i mean were definitely at fault to a degree
2013-11-22 14:40:05	jhartigan	but they did it worse
2013-11-22 14:40:09	jhartigan	im 90% sure they owe 500
2013-11-22 14:40:13	kweaver	because we werent expecting them to just pay us during that meeting
2013-11-22 14:40:18	jhartigan	yeah
2013-11-22 14:40:18	kweaver	that sounds right
2013-11-22 14:40:26	jhartigan	cause he gave us 800 i think
2013-11-22 14:41:23	jhartigan	500 site and hosting
2013-11-22 14:41:28	jhartigan	which i guess we moved sometime round then
2013-11-22 14:41:48	jhartigan	dunno.. i guess at the end of the day, its better we clsoe this out, and just move them to CC/25/month in june
2013-11-22 14:43:21	jhartigan	ugh i wish pnc had labels like simple
2013-11-22 14:43:30	jhartigan	we could keep track of payments visually so easily
2013-11-22 15:28:05	kweaver1	jhartigan so I just set up my dad with a VM recurring $20 - month
2013-11-22 15:28:16	kweaver1	and it doesnt offer any sort of automated emailing
2013-11-22 15:28:18	kweaver1	or anything
2013-11-22 15:28:21	kweaver1	soooooo
2013-11-22 15:28:28	kweaver1	I REALLLY want to build that app soon
2013-11-22 15:28:32	kweaver1	even just for that
2013-11-22 15:29:42	kweaver1	the norm seems to be an invoice email a week before due, and a receipt email once it goes through
2013-11-22 15:33:05	jhartigan	yeah thats probably good to have
2013-11-22 15:33:09	jhartigan	not havving email is shitty
2013-11-22 15:33:17	jhartigan	we can just use smtp with a template
2013-11-22 15:33:19	jhartigan	sorry was tlakin to the moms
2013-11-22 15:33:26	kweaver1	np
2013-11-22 15:33:29	kweaver1	yeah thats what I thought
2013-11-22 15:33:31	jhartigan	gotta run out right quick should be back at 4
2013-11-22 15:33:35	jhartigan	gonna do the app
2013-11-22 15:33:41	kweaver1	I figure while im doing newsletter email
2013-11-22 15:33:45	kweaver1	I might as well make us on too
2013-11-22 15:33:51	jhartigan	mlg at 530 so ill probably poke at it while watching
2013-11-22 15:33:56	kweaver1	for that automated monthly email and receipt
2013-11-22 15:34:05	jhartigan	yeah. if we can get smtp to work wll enough
2013-11-22 15:35:18	jhartigan	if not.. ill setup https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSMTP
2013-11-22 16:25:47	kweaver1	jhartigan:  we should probably get a signed contract from barsu with all of usual details
2013-11-22 16:26:55	jhartigan	most likely ya.. give em that goddamn 30 day shit too so they dont worry about changes in the next month
2013-11-22 16:27:25	kweaver1	ill send this out before the invoice then
2013-11-22 16:27:38	kweaver1	or maybe just make it 1 doc
2013-11-22 16:27:47	kweaver1	ill do that
2013-11-22 16:28:00	jhartigan	yeah might as well
2013-11-22 16:28:07	jhartigan	im gonna make the changes to the dentist today
2013-11-22 16:28:14	jhartigan	well.. maybe not
2013-11-22 16:28:24	jhartigan	she hasnt responded with how she wants that damn content
2013-11-22 16:29:17	kweaver1	jhartigan do you know off hand where to change smtp setting in magento?  my dad wants to just use his eastsales@comcast.net for it
2013-11-22 16:29:44	jhartigan	theres like 6 email addresses the site uses
2013-11-22 16:29:48	jhartigan	under general
2013-11-22 16:29:51	jhartigan	i can change em
2013-11-22 16:29:56	jhartigan	but thats assuming he can use comcast to do it
2013-11-22 16:29:56	kweaver1	if you want
2013-11-22 16:29:59	kweaver1	http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/email-client-programs-with-xfinity-email/

2013-11-25 12:05:11	kweaver_laptop	I forget a couple classes that we will want 
2013-11-25 12:05:14	kweaver_laptop	forgot*

2013-11-25 12:56:35	jhartigan	happened all day saturdays
2013-11-25 12:57:03	jhartigan	you shouldnt be breaking anything on the slider though dont worry bout dat
2013-11-25 12:58:27	kweaver_laptop	k ill push soon
2013-11-25 12:59:08	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan can you double check to make sure im not cray
2013-11-25 12:59:13	jhartigan	alrighty.  imma get some food right quick and then im good.  if i drop again.. its most likely comcast, but theres always a chance of meatalls
2013-11-25 12:59:20	kweaver_laptop	did they ever require x number of thumbs?
2013-11-25 12:59:23	kweaver_laptop	or just 3 always
2013-11-25 12:59:34	jhartigan	i dont remember anything about a requirement of number
2013-11-25 12:59:38	jhartigan	just lazy loading
2013-11-25 12:59:43	kweaver_laptop	k thats what I thought
2013-11-25 12:59:46	jhartigan	with dynamically created thumbs
2013-11-25 12:59:52	kweaver_laptop	i skimmed too, but wasnt sure if they mentioned anything
2013-11-25 12:59:54	jhartigan	and toggling of the thumbs
2013-11-25 13:00:06	kweaver_laptop	and overriding default thumbs
2013-11-25 13:00:08	kweaver_laptop	which is odd
2013-11-25 13:00:29	jhartigan	yeah... alot of the specs are kind of odd
2013-11-25 13:00:35	kweaver_laptop	I figure by default, they dont enter any thumb section and the js will generate it with all the same thumbs
2013-11-25 13:00:48	kweaver_laptop	then if they want no thumbs, the set a js var
2013-11-25 13:01:15	kweaver_laptop	then if they want specific thumbs, they paste the full thumbs section and manually change the ones they need

2013-11-26 10:20:20	kweaver	ill probably end up waiting 4 hours  for him and then he'll tell me that he has to take his niece to the park
2013-11-26 10:20:35	kweaver	Ive only seen 2 commits come from the bmi calc
2013-11-26 10:20:42	kweaver	so I want to see what hes up to

2013-11-26 10:21:14	kweaver	did you see I started the responsive layout for the slider?
2013-11-26 10:21:19	jhartigan	yeah thats a good idea. I havent looked at the bmi fora few days
2013-11-26 10:21:36	jhartigan	hmm? did you push that at some point? I merged your shit into mine yesterday night

2013-11-26 10:22:03	kweaver	if you load the index you should see it
2013-11-26 10:22:23	kweaver	its just the barebones layout, but the rest should only take me like 2 hours
2013-11-26 10:22:45	kweaver	then I was gonna see how you were doing with the js, and how tom was doing with everything
2013-11-26 10:22:50	kweaver	figured id just bounce
2013-11-26 10:25:05	jhartigan	 bounce bounce bounce bounce
2013-11-26 10:25:18	jhartigan	some people call it hip hop, trance, dance, rock and pop

2013-11-26 11:43:51	jhartigan	in the winter, and she said it made camden look like a playground
2013-11-26 12:17:24	jhartigan	oh yo i found this yesterday

2013-11-26 12:49:49	kweaver	also, im cool with just using that
2013-11-26 12:49:56	kweaver	vim deal
2013-11-26 12:50:40	kweaver	the design of programmer blogs always amuses me
2013-11-26 12:50:58	kweaver	the guy went through the trouble of adding that nifty on-hover zoom sidebar
2013-11-26 12:51:12	kweaver	but left the default typeface as times new roman
2013-11-26 12:52:14	kweaver	even the rest of his blog uses Open Sans
2013-11-26 12:54:15	kweaver	and you can tell he probably designed the blog himself, since if you go to the blog section, it just lists all of the posts in full with no minification or read more buttons
2013-11-26 12:55:27	jhartigan	hahahah very true. I actually did nothing other than click the link and read it.. didn't look at anything else on it hah

2013-12-06 13:24:15	kweaver	jhartigan: might have an issue
2013-12-06 13:25:02	kweaver	I could have sworn that on PWS, we were just sending email from his gmail, but it must have been lithium or something
2013-12-06 13:25:37	kweaver	sent via his comcast address, I am getting images but no CSS loaded
2013-12-06 13:25:48	kweaver	sent via his gmail address, I am getting no images or css loaded
2013-12-06 13:36:44	kweaver	hmmmmm
2013-12-06 13:48:33	kweaver	might have gotten it
2013-12-06 14:06:47	kweaver	just need to change some functionality in the wysiwyg editor and we are golden
2013-12-06 14:52:07	jhartigan	shit sorry was on the laptop.. lemme know if you still need help ill try and help out
2013-12-06 14:57:35	kweaver	im balls deep and im almost there
2013-12-06 14:57:48	kweaver	everything works perfectly
2013-12-06 14:57:51	kweaver	the only problem
2013-12-06 14:58:09	kweaver	is the wysiwyg for magento strips body tags 
2013-12-06 14:58:34	kweaver	because it tries to be XHTML compatible
2013-12-06 14:58:40	kweaver	which is admirable
2013-12-06 14:58:56	kweaver	the wysiwyg they use is called tinyMCE
2013-12-06 14:59:28	kweaver	and it has a config file to allow whatever tags you want
2013-12-06 14:59:37	kweaver	but its not working, and the docs are kinda bad
2013-12-06 14:59:58	jhartigan	tinymce is pretty common, but CKEditor is better and even more commo
2013-12-06 15:00:06	jhartigan	theres no way to replace it is there?/
2013-12-06 15:01:48	kweaver	could be, but before I look into yanking it from every page entirely, you can definitely allow the tags
2013-12-06 15:02:47	kweaver	jhartigan, just finish up anything going on with Holdbrook, work on anything else in that to do list, and Im thinking we just send out a quick email to any of our currently active clients saying we will be busy
2013-12-06 15:02:58	kweaver	all next week
2013-12-06 15:03:16	kweaver	only the ones we're actively doing stuff for 
2013-12-06 15:10:45	kweaver	jhartigan tom pushed
2013-12-06 15:10:57	kweaver	he mentioned that it just needed to be styled
2013-12-06 15:11:11	kweaver	but he hasnt done any graphing either
2013-12-06 15:11:52	kweaver	pull and check it
2013-12-06 15:12:35	kweaver	Now I'm wondering if starting an entirely new project 10 days before nemours is a good idea.. 
2013-12-06 15:19:12	jhartigan	I mean its not going to get finished this weekend, but whats your concens?
2013-12-06 15:22:40	kweaver	with that knowledge, would it be smarter just work on nemours this weekend?
2013-12-06 15:23:43	kweaver	now that Ive seen where the BMI is, im still very confident in our ability to everything with nemours, but Im not 100% that just the two of us can handle the rest in 5 just days
2013-12-06 15:39:20	jhartigan	well im down to work on nemours. plus matts got a party and tom wants to do his show, and you have girlfriendly duties to tend to. we might as well just put in some work on nenours this weekend and we can spend too days after xmas id assume doing shit for a payment gateway
2013-12-06 15:40:16	kweaver	so should we just go chill for just a bit tomorrow then?
2013-12-06 15:40:58	kweaver	just grab food, play some ssbm, and work on whatever for like a few hours
2013-12-06 15:41:03	kweaver	then go back home and do nemours
2013-12-06 15:41:20	jhartigan	i mean we can do it in whatever order ya
2013-12-06 15:41:28	jhartigan	but even if we just work on nemours for a bit while there
2013-12-06 15:41:35	jhartigan	3 heads for like 3 hours is a good thing
2013-12-06 15:41:46	kweaver	yeah that works
2013-12-06 15:42:07	jhartigan	i mean where toms at with the bmi is nice cause all the goundworks gone
2013-12-06 15:42:12	jhartigan	ill go though it and nemours it
2013-12-06 15:42:18	jhartigan	but plotting wont be too hard i dont think
2013-12-06 15:42:24	jhartigan	could be wrong, but i dont think it will
2013-12-06 15:42:26	jhartigan	then its styling
2013-12-06 15:42:28	jhartigan	ill do what i can

2013-12-18 20:39:34	kweaver	yeah 
2013-12-18 20:39:56	kweaver	ended up rewriting the aspect ratio in a way thats probably 50x more effecient
2013-12-18 20:40:00	kweaver	almost done now
2013-12-18 20:40:04	jhartigan	how was the sbux?
2013-12-18 20:40:08	kweaver	it was fine
2013-12-18 20:40:13	jhartigan	lol jesuss
2013-12-18 20:40:19	jhartigan	glad you got it working for ya though
2013-12-18 20:41:14	jhartigan	well i got fuckin so tired at like 4ish so i ended up nappin hard planning to stay up overnight so ill probably get some good work done and thisll hopefully put me on a normal sleep rotation
2013-12-18 20:41:26	jhartigan	lemme know when you wanna push and il pull that down
2013-12-18 20:41:51	kweaver	you wanna meet up tomorrow?  I figure we basically need to be finished everything by tomorrow afternoon, so that we can be IE testing through the night  
2013-12-18 20:42:02	kweaver	not pushable yet
2013-12-18 20:42:10	kweaver	probs another 20 minutes
2013-12-18 20:42:54	jhartigan	yeah we can meet up
2013-12-18 20:43:14	jhartigan	i dont know what you have udner the everything list, but ill have probably everything done tonight / early morning
2013-12-18 20:43:29	jhartigan	all i have are the thumbs and fix lazy load
2013-12-18 20:43:32	jhartigan	what else is there
2013-12-18 20:43:39	kweaver	lemme check the lsit
2013-12-18 20:44:35	kweaver	whered you leave off with lazyload?
2013-12-18 20:45:13	jhartigan	it just doesnt work with the non on scroll call
2013-12-18 20:45:55	kweaver	Im also going to operate under the assumption that tom may or may not end up doing the percentile calc
2013-12-18 20:46:45	kweaver	he hasnt looked at the new version we received
2013-12-18 20:46:52	kweaver	as of at least this afternoon
2013-12-18 20:47:08	jhartigan	oh okay well ill look at that after thumbs are done then
2013-12-18 20:47:29	kweaver	yeah just make sure everything is done with the slider
2013-12-18 20:47:55	kweaver	I honestly wouldnt even look at the bmi until we are 100% finished IE testing the slider
2013-12-18 20:48:07	kweaver	id rather be 100% finished one project then 90% finished both
2013-12-18 20:48:11	jhartigan	yeah as far as i know the autoplay, which will be 2 min, thumbnails and then echo are it for the slider
2013-12-18 20:48:32	kweaver	plus, if tom doesnt get percentile and IE8 testing done before friday
2013-12-18 20:48:35	kweaver	its his own fault
2013-12-18 20:48:40	kweaver	in which case
2013-12-18 20:49:01	kweaver	we would probably have to have a stern talk with him about conducting future projects
2013-12-18 20:49:02	kweaver	lol
2013-12-18 20:51:02	kweaver	ok i need to focus on this function before I get lost again
2013-12-18 20:51:05	kweaver	ill be around
2013-12-18 20:51:20	jhartigan	yeahd dude
2013-12-18 20:51:26	jhartigan	do it up lemme know when to pull
2013-12-18 20:51:32	jhartigan	imma figure out some food and lift

2013-12-18 22:32:26	kweaver	jakenbake: 
2013-12-18 22:33:45	kweaver	gonna push aspect ratio.  now we just need to have it set on onload and an onresize that loops through all the slide images and then all the thumbnails
2013-12-18 22:34:07	jakenbake	why not just call it on resize of the slider
2013-12-18 22:34:14	jakenbake	so its not calling on multiple events
2013-12-18 22:34:47	kweaver	yeah thats what I mean
2013-12-18 22:35:16	kweaver	as well as onload
2013-12-18 22:41:43	jakenbake	also maybe im crazy
2013-12-18 22:41:47	jakenbake	why adjust it constantly
2013-12-18 22:41:49	jakenbake	set it once
2013-12-18 22:41:58	jakenbake	and if its resized properly the ratio never changes
2013-12-18 22:43:15	kweaver	the problem is that we arent actually adjusting or cropping the image
2013-12-18 22:43:30	kweaver	we have to adjust the image inside of the container
2013-12-18 22:43:36	kweaver	which is inside of another container
2013-12-18 22:43:48	kweaver	all of which have variable widths and heights
2013-12-18 22:43:55	jakenbake	yeah but why not jsut adjust the image when its loaded once
2013-12-18 22:44:09	kweaver	youll see when I push this pup
2013-12-18 22:45:18	jakenbake	nah i dont get the reason though.  if the ratio is set. it shouldnt change on resize unless i dont understand images
2013-12-18 22:45:56	kweaver	I know why youre thinking that, because I imagined this being simpler than it actually is
2013-12-18 22:46:14	kweaver	here
2013-12-18 22:46:22	kweaver	so i dont mess up the master version
2013-12-18 22:46:33	kweaver	git checkout -b ratio
2013-12-18 22:46:36	kweaver	git pull origin ratio
2013-12-18 22:46:41	kweaver	and check out my function
2013-12-18 22:46:57	kweaver	i had to hardcode thumbnails in there while I was working on them
2013-12-18 22:47:08	kweaver	so I dont want to fugup master
2013-12-18 22:48:12	kweaver	I have 3 scenarios. thumbnail too wide, thumbnail too tall, and slide image too wide
2013-12-18 22:49:00	kweaver	I commented it to shit too since its pretty complex
2013-12-18 22:50:25	kweaver	disregard the verticalAlign() function, I no longer use that
2013-12-18 22:51:54	kweaver	essentaily, we are manipulating both the image and the image container
2013-12-18 22:53:38	kweaver	for thumbnails, the image container needs to take up 26% width of the parent, and the appropriate height of a 3:2 ratio
2013-12-18 22:54:33	kweaver	then we need to make sure the image inside, and set to one absolute value and one auto,  if we set two absolute values, the image will appear squished
2013-12-18 22:55:09	kweaver	then we need to set a negative margin to appropriately center it within the container
2013-12-18 22:56:30	jakenbake	i mean it running looks fine to me, i just dont see why the image cant be scalled to the ratio, which you have the three cases for, once and then just rely on proper responsiveness
2013-12-18 22:57:19	kweaver	because the issue is that there is no simple way to tell and image to just keep a ratio, without squishing
2013-12-18 22:57:26	kweaver	tell an**
2013-12-18 22:58:39	kweaver	so instead of squishing it, we can just the ratio of the container, and center the image within that
2013-12-18 22:58:51	kweaver	and we have to keep checking if the image is centered
2013-12-18 22:59:25	kweaver	just keep the ratio of the container**
2013-12-18 23:00:48	kweaver	its sort of a similar concept to that backstretch plugin, only the container is variable too
2013-12-18 23:03:03	jakenbake	okay i follow you.  that makes sense to me
2013-12-18 23:04:05	kweaver	yeah trust me, if you google the terms "javascript image aspect ratio" on my computer, youll find like 3 pages of purple links
2013-12-18 23:04:51	kweaver	I tried literally every single stack overflow answer, and they all couldnt relate to our scenario with variable height AND width in the container AND the image
2013-12-18 23:06:10	jakenbake	pics or it didnt happen
2013-12-19 00:18:53	kweaver	jakenbake
2013-12-19 00:19:04	kweaver	I didnt think wed have much to worry about the mobile layout
2013-12-19 00:19:09	kweaver	but they do some surprisingly stupid things
2013-12-19 00:19:26	kweaver	like no allow any images past 98%
2013-12-19 00:19:32	kweaver	Ill be able to override them
2013-12-19 00:19:46	kweaver	but be sure to check what youre doing on all of their lame layouts
2013-12-19 00:52:42	kweaver	sup jakenbake 
2013-12-19 01:06:20	kweaver	bleh deadlines suck
2013-12-19 01:12:46	kweaver	I know it sounds like theres only a couple items left on the to do, but I think we are going to have a hard time getting them both complete and IE8 ready by friday
2013-12-19 01:30:44	jakenbake	i think IE 8 is most likely the main problem that lies ahead,  i dunno how much of a pain in the ass it is, but i dont think till be easy
2013-12-19 01:32:18	kweaver	how are you doing with the thumb navs?
2013-12-19 01:32:30	kweaver	thats a little sucker too
2013-12-19 01:33:35	jakenbake	nah its not

2013-12-19 01:33:38	jakenbake	why would it be?
2013-12-19 01:33:49	jakenbake	i have the scenarios worked out on paper
2013-12-19 01:33:58	jakenbake	but i dont see why theyre a problem over all
2013-12-19 01:34:09	kweaver	I just mean its the only piece of functionality left
2013-12-19 01:34:27	kweaver	im about to push the controls overlay
2013-12-19 01:35:10	jakenbake	k lemme know and ill merge it in before i work these scenarios into actual code
2013-12-19 01:41:35	kweaver	pushed jakenbake 
2013-12-19 01:42:58	jakenbake	kweaver: is there a puse logo?
2013-12-19 01:43:01	jakenbake	pause*
2013-12-19 01:43:19	kweaver	working on that now on the lappy
2013-12-19 01:43:38	kweaver	gotta photoshop one real quick
2013-12-19 01:44:10	jakenbake	ooh okay.. just making sure my shit was working with the class swap
2013-12-19 01:44:13	jakenbake	looks good though
2013-12-19 01:48:03	kweaver	in order to have one set of controls that overlays all of the slide images, we have to use some js to find the correct height for it
2013-12-19 01:48:18	kweaver	its just one line though
2013-12-19 01:48:39	kweaver	the other option would be controls over every single image
2013-12-19 01:52:52	jakenbake	i saw you mentioned the ie 8 shit and all to tom.  any response from him about what hes got left?  just IE and cpercentile right?
2013-12-19 01:53:24	kweaver	yeah I texted him too
2013-12-19 01:53:30	kweaver	hes at some party
2013-12-19 01:53:32	kweaver	lol
2013-12-19 01:53:45	kweaver	he was like "this friday or next friday??"
2013-12-19 01:54:07	kweaver	I was like "dude.. this friday."
2013-12-19 01:54:14	jakenbake	haha wattt.  shouldnt two things be relatively simple to have done from monday -> friday
2013-12-19 01:54:28	kweaver	I dont know how else to describe the urgency of our situation
2013-12-19 01:55:56	kweaver	thats another reason Im stressing a little. because I have to work on the assumption that tom is just going to play CS tomorrow
2013-12-19 01:55:57	kweaver	lol
2013-12-19 01:56:13	jakenbake	lolol
2013-12-19 02:36:24	kweaver	just pushed jakenbake 
2013-12-19 02:37:14	kweaver	I was just looking at the origin docs and they have   "...read me" 
2013-12-19 02:37:24	kweaver	so im gonna change it in your script jakenbake 
2013-12-19 02:37:26	kweaver	just dont be alarmed
2013-12-19 02:37:34	kweaver	when you have to merge that line

2013-12-19 02:40:17	kweaver	but the dots are on the read more link
2013-12-19 02:40:22	kweaver	like    "...read more"
2013-12-19 02:40:24	jakenbake	no dont

2013-12-19 02:46:26	jakenbake	i can change it though
2013-12-19 02:46:32	jakenbake	read me is fucking silly though but thats okay
2013-12-19 02:46:47	kweaver	fuck these typos

2013-12-19 02:50:37	kweaver	but when you said "were not changing that"
2013-12-19 02:50:48	kweaver	did you mean it would be too hard of a fix to remove it from the left side?
2013-12-19 02:52:36	jakenbake	not necessarily no
2013-12-19 02:52:47	kweaver	I assumed when you said "were not changing that" you were basically saying "fuck that, its not worth the time redoing what I did"
2013-12-19 02:53:03	kweaver	so if its a pain in the dick, just throw the extra ... on the read more string
2013-12-19 02:53:12	kweaver	if its not a pain, just remove it from the left side as well
2013-12-19 02:55:18	jakenbake	yeah it shouldnt be a problem
2013-12-19 03:14:41	kweaver	alright jakenbake im looking at this in IE8
2013-12-19 03:15:09	kweaver	the good news is the styling looks almost fine
2013-12-19 03:15:17	jakenbake	i figured as much
2013-12-19 03:15:26	jakenbake	i thought that our main problem would be normalizing js
2013-12-19 03:15:38	kweaver	yeah
2013-12-19 03:15:51	kweaver	it basically looks like it would for a user without js
2013-12-19 03:16:00	kweaver	but thats what i figured 
2013-12-19 03:16:02	jakenbake	lol really?
2013-12-19 03:16:20	kweaver	yeah its just all 3 slides, no controls or anything
2013-12-19 03:16:32	kweaver	for the cost of browser stack dude
2013-12-19 03:16:41	kweaver	this is reallllly slow
2013-12-19 03:17:26	kweaver	and you cant resize the browser
2013-12-19 03:17:56	kweaver	nm you can
2013-12-19 03:19:24	jakenbake	lol i was gonna say
2013-12-19 03:19:30	jakenbake	but i was still gonna use windows for it'
2013-12-19 03:19:45	kweaver	yeah i will too
2013-12-19 03:19:56	kweaver	once were in debug mode, we should put it on oms1
2013-12-19 03:20:49	jakenbake	yeah i figured that was the easist to do
2013-12-19 03:25:02	kweaver	jakenbake I remember you talking about echo, but I forget what you said about that status of lazyloading?
2013-12-19 03:25:26	jakenbake	its not working
2013-12-19 03:25:34	jakenbake	only wants to work on the scroll method
2013-12-19 03:25:38	kweaver	alright
2013-12-19 03:25:38	jakenbake	not on the render one
2013-12-19 03:25:47	kweaver	we can look at it once thumbnails are donezo
2013-12-19 03:26:39	kweaver	im just organizing the final to do
2013-12-19 03:26:45	kweaver	gonna email it with tom as well
2013-12-19 03:28:34	jakenbake	okay thats cool
2013-12-19 03:28:37	jakenbake	yeah get some sleep bro
2013-12-19 03:28:42	jakenbake	im gonna be up but i napped
2013-12-19 03:29:22	kweaver	yeah once I send this out im off
2013-12-19 03:30:36	kweaver	see if you can get down the thumbnails and then sleep what you need to, but you should head over whenever youre done 
2013-12-19 03:30:50	jakenbake	im not gonna sleep today
2013-12-19 03:30:54	jakenbake	dont have it in me
2013-12-19 03:30:55	kweaver	I have a feeling tomorrow is going to be another all nighter
2013-12-19 03:30:58	jakenbake	slept till 10 somethin
2013-12-19 03:31:07	jakenbake	and then napped later in the day
2013-12-19 03:31:55	kweaver	alright just sleep at some point because I think tomorrow night is going to have to be a marathon as well
2013-12-19 03:32:11	kweaver	this time im not buying mocha coffee from wawa
2013-12-19 03:32:13	kweaver	that was gross
2013-12-19 03:32:29	jakenbake	lolol yeah i hear you haha
2013-12-19 03:32:42	jakenbake	im stickin with tea
2013-12-19 03:32:49	jakenbake	lemme know when you get up but get yerself some sleep
2013-12-19 03:32:56	jakenbake	i dont think that IE8 should take the whole day
2013-12-19 03:34:19	kweaver	if my aspect ratio doesnt down in IE8, Im just going to give them some fixed ratios and squish the image
2013-12-19 03:34:32	kweaver	they dont deserve my aspect ratio function
2013-12-19 03:34:35	jakenbake	so presuming i finish all functionality.. although not sure wwhat to do for echo i dont think ie8 could take all day
2013-12-19 03:34:43	jakenbake	only because the underlying js has to have been ported
2013-12-19 03:36:46	jakenbake	plus... we could nag dave but i dont like doing that to him since its not just for learning its for a project as well
2013-12-19 03:36:51	jakenbake	he says he doesnt mind but
2013-12-19 03:37:16	kweaver	yeah lets only nag him if we have to
2013-12-19 03:37:51	kweaver	if you can get thumbnailNav finished, I would call tonight a success

2013-12-19 20:04:49	jakenbake	hi kweaver_desktop how goes it?  sorry totest slept through my 7om alarm
2013-12-19 20:05:06	kweaver_desktop	nah its fine
2013-12-19 20:05:11	kweaver_desktop	its good
2013-12-19 20:06:55	kweaver_desktop	cashed those checks, got the files for the drupal site, did the holdbrook update, looked at the bmi for a bit, and then ive been reading through your slide code 
2013-12-19 20:07:06	kweaver_desktop	i dont know if that lazyload plugin will work for us
2013-12-19 20:07:22	kweaver_desktop	its very simple, just loads a js file or a css file when you tell it to
2013-12-19 20:07:26	kweaver_desktop	not even specific functions
2013-12-19 20:07:29	kweaver_desktop	just a file it seems
2013-12-19 20:07:53	kweaver_desktop	which doesnt work if were going to be working with a minified js and a minified css
2013-12-19 20:09:11	kweaver_desktop	tom said the bmi works on IE8, but I looked at it and the input entry fields dont even load, so i didnt even get to see if the the graphing works or anything
2013-12-19 20:09:31	kweaver_desktop	I asked him and he just said it works for him lol, so i dunno
2013-12-19 20:13:54	kweaver_desktop	I also ran it through an xhtml scanner and were just missing a few things like alt tags on images and type tags on script tags
2013-12-19 20:16:24	kweaver_desktop	well jakenbake, I bought 4 five-hour energies and ive got a bunch of coffee here
2013-12-19 20:23:00	jakenbake	lolol.  1) i think i can do a lazy load myself if i dont get it to work just based on how the one i found works  2) so for alt tags, can I put 'slideshow-image-x'?  3) wat with tom... is it on oms1?
2013-12-19 20:25:45	kweaver_desktop	1. yeah echo looks more like what we want, or some personalized variation.  i can look at it too to say why it wouldnt be working.  2. yes. 3. nah, I just used browserstack
2013-12-19 20:26:48	jakenbake	haha okay.  wanted to look at it right quick
2013-12-19 20:27:18	kweaver_desktop	although browserstack is pretty slow, it is nice to have a VM of every possible OS and every browser all just a couple clicks away
2013-12-19 20:27:23	jakenbake	kweaver_desktop: for the alt tags... this shit doesnt pull from a non rendered site right?  like all that content would come from a site that has js right?
2013-12-19 20:27:32	jakenbake	oh another find
2013-12-19 20:27:41	jakenbake	IE8 console works if dev tools is opened haha
2013-12-19 20:28:31	kweaver_desktop	i tried looking at the console for ours and it either wasnt loaded, or ie just doesnt feel nice enough to give errors
2013-12-19 20:28:41	kweaver_desktop	i assume it was the first reason
2013-12-19 20:28:55	jakenbake	yeah you have to load the dev tools
2013-12-19 20:28:59	jakenbake	then refresh the page
2013-12-19 20:29:07	kweaver_desktop	aye
2013-12-19 20:29:48	kweaver_desktop	anyway did you wanna come over?  you dont have to but I think late nights are easier with another person there
2013-12-19 20:35:49	kweaver_desktop	jakenbake your slider code looks really good
2013-12-19 20:36:06	jakenbake	yeah ill come over.

2013-12-26 10:38:04	kweaver	sounds good
2013-12-26 10:38:16	kweaver	i was also thinking
2013-12-26 10:39:10	jakenbake	we bedazzle the slider?
2013-12-26 10:39:19	jakenbake	not gonna lie i thought about ti
2013-12-26 10:39:20	kweaver	yes, chirstmas colors
2013-12-26 10:39:49	kweaver	just so we have a better grasp of how much we'll be refactoring for IE.  I wanna run through really quick with the IE and just comment or set stub values on all the lines that we get IE8 errors
2013-12-26 10:40:41	jakenbake	yeah thats what i was planning on doin
2013-12-26 10:40:46	kweaver	just so we know ahead of time how much we have to chang
2013-12-26 10:40:55	jakenbake	its good for future in general and future with them if we have one
2013-12-26 10:42:18	jakenbake	im installing the ms ievms on the laptop
2013-12-26 10:42:25	jakenbake	gotta make the dev go faster
2013-12-26 10:42:45	kweaver	good idea
2013-12-26 10:42:59	kweaver	what vm's you using
2013-12-26 10:43:03	kweaver	ill install too
2013-12-26 10:44:07	jakenbake	http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads
2013-12-26 10:44:10	jakenbake	ms provides them
2013-12-26 10:44:18	jakenbake	heres the thing. make sure after you install them
2013-12-26 10:44:21	jakenbake	you image them
2013-12-26 10:44:28	jakenbake	else youll have to redownload and install
2013-12-26 10:44:35	jakenbake	as they expire after 30days
2013-12-26 10:44:44	jakenbake	so you just image rollback for it
2013-12-26 10:45:15	kweaver	how do you image them?
2013-12-26 10:46:29	jakenbake	like in vbox
2013-12-26 10:46:32	jakenbake	you hit take snapshot
2013-12-26 10:46:40	jakenbake	that way you just roll back to the snapshot
2013-12-26 10:46:49	kweaver	oh ok wasnt sure if it was harder than that
2013-12-26 10:47:20	jakenbake	nah. ms just did as much work as they wanted and i guess should although the only reason is because they suck that we need them
2013-12-26 10:53:48	kweaver	you gonna test it on XP IE8?
2013-12-26 10:53:53	kweaver	dunno if theres a diff
2013-12-26 10:54:12	kweaver	just figured Ill install XP and vista, but use XP mainly
2013-12-26 11:00:42	jakenbake	i was just gonna do IE8 opnyl on xp for now

2013-12-29 16:08:31	kweaver	well if I learned one thing from this experience, its to give tom his own special deadline
2013-12-29 16:09:00	kweaver	another thing, I think we could have added at least a couple more days to the quote
2013-12-29 16:09:11	jakenbake	yeah i dont think we needed to specify the 16th
2013-12-29 16:09:11	kweaver	but I think we were pretty close in our estimate

2013-12-30 19:16:20	kweaver	jakenbake the work around I was thinking of would be a little hacky
2013-12-30 19:16:25	kweaver	im testing now
2013-12-30 19:16:30	kweaver	now so much hacky
2013-12-30 19:17:21	kweaver	basically the reason is that all other browsers know the width of the images by the time they are loaded with the data-override
2013-12-30 19:17:33	kweaver	but chrome thinks its infinity
2013-12-30 19:17:51	kweaver	and stepping through with the debugger
2013-12-30 19:18:25	kweaver	even through every step of the load, the image never appear until after all of the initial javascript is completely done
2013-12-30 19:31:53	kweaver	dude this bug is elusiveeee.  it just happens some of the time
2013-12-30 19:32:13	kweaver	I think always the first load, but then refreshing its like 50%
2013-12-30 19:32:25	kweaver	unless this is just caching
2013-12-30 19:41:16	jakenbake	hmm
2013-12-30 19:41:18	jakenbake	i asked dave
2013-12-30 19:41:22	jakenbake	and he said it was odd
2013-12-30 19:41:26	jakenbake	maybe if we were to delay something?
2013-12-30 19:41:49	jakenbake	also lazy load didnt work in my tests a bit ago
2013-12-30 19:41:57	kweaver	ok Ill look at it
2013-12-30 19:44:31	kweaver	I mean
2013-12-30 19:44:37	kweaver	the really hacky way
2013-12-30 19:45:17	kweaver	would be to just have a function thats called when the dom if finished using this guy
2013-12-30 19:45:21	kweaver	document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
2013-12-30 19:45:21	kweaver	   // your code here
2013-12-30 19:45:21	kweaver	}, false);
2013-12-30 19:45:40	kweaver	click the next button on the nav, and then click the previous button
2013-12-30 19:45:47	kweaver	or just reload the images
2013-12-30 19:46:00	jakenbake	yeah sure
2013-12-30 19:46:07	jakenbake	hmm
2013-12-30 19:46:07	kweaver	I dunno why im calling it hacky though, cause this is entirely chromes fault
2013-12-30 19:49:17	jakenbake	yeah its all webkit
2013-12-30 19:49:38	jakenbake	uhm lemme see.. if you know what the problem is.. would a delay somewhere help it?
2013-12-30 19:49:40	kweaver	yeah him
2013-12-30 19:50:01	kweaver	I was playing with delays that one night
2013-12-30 19:50:06	kweaver	but my brian was fuzzy
2013-12-30 19:50:21	kweaver	lemme try this function real quick, if it doesnt work, ill try delays again
2013-12-30 19:50:21	jakenbake	yeah if it was that nigt...
2013-12-30 19:50:28	kweaver	dont worry about this bug
2013-12-30 19:50:28	jakenbake	ill ask dave
2013-12-30 19:50:37	kweaver	ill get it
2013-12-30 19:50:51	kweaver	if anything, feel free to start tidying up or something
2013-12-30 19:51:55	kweaver	you can pull #kh-slideshow-1 and -2 initializations out of slider.js too if you want
2013-12-30 19:52:32	kweaver	we're in almost ship mode now
2013-12-30 19:55:36	jakenbake	alrighty.. pulling that shit out is mad easy
2013-12-30 19:55:39	jakenbake	ill do that at the very end
2013-12-30 20:32:52	kweaver	you there jakenbake?
2013-12-30 20:33:33	kweaver	reloading the images didnt work
2013-12-30 20:33:45	kweaver	im thinking we just try the next
2013-12-30 20:33:49	kweaver	and reverse
2013-12-30 20:36:21	kweaver	son of a bitch..
2013-12-30 20:36:25	kweaver	sooo
2013-12-30 20:36:31	kweaver	that didnt work either
2013-12-30 20:36:33	kweaver	...
2013-12-30 20:36:39	kweaver	back to the delays
2013-12-30 20:48:25	jakenbake	so hitting next and prev doesnt work?
2013-12-30 20:48:30	jakenbake	it must need a delay then
2013-12-30 20:48:38	jakenbake	cause it works otherwise
2013-12-30 20:51:08	kweaver	thats what im thinking
2013-12-30 20:51:19	kweaver	playing with it now
2013-12-30 20:52:22	jakenbake	ive had it work like 2x in chrome randomly
2013-12-30 20:52:33	kweaver	keep refreshing
2013-12-30 20:52:38	kweaver	it goes through spurts
2013-12-30 20:52:53	kweaver	there were a few times where I thought i fixed it cause it worked like 4 times in a row
2013-12-30 20:52:59	kweaver	its stupid
2013-12-30 21:03:49	kweaver	hey jakenbake, you wanna know another reason why outlook 365 is terrible?  their email forwarding works like 80% of the time, and then the rest, it takes an extra 6-8 hours to deliver
2013-12-30 21:04:14	kweaver	luckily i checked it today
2013-12-30 21:04:24	kweaver	but i just finally got an email from this morning
2013-12-30 21:08:23	jakenbake	oh shit.. i acutally never check mine out
2013-12-30 21:14:40	kweaver	just set it to forward
2013-12-30 21:15:18	jakenbake	yeah its on forward but i dont ever log into it
2013-12-30 21:15:24	kweaver	ok
2013-12-30 21:15:27	kweaver	yeah they eventually come
2013-12-30 21:15:31	kweaver	but late 
2013-12-30 21:15:38	kweaver	i wouldnt worry about it for you
2013-12-30 21:15:42	kweaver	but i get shit to this every day
2013-12-30 21:16:09	kweaver	lee said you can set it up to use that email on gmail
2013-12-30 21:16:19	kweaver	so I told him hes going to show me next time we go to bc
2013-12-30 21:17:00	kweaver	or rather
2013-12-30 21:17:16	kweaver	he has it set to go to his gmail and respond to it from there or something
2013-12-30 21:17:18	kweaver	i forget
2013-12-30 21:17:39	kweaver	whatever it is, he doesnt use that garbage and im jelly

2013-12-31 09:50:56	jakenbake	kweaver: got yer mail earlier. sorry was in bed at like 9 and just finished trimming the hair and attempted to trim the beard
2013-12-31 09:51:02	jakenbake	i dont think the nav will be too hard
2013-12-31 09:51:11	jakenbake	is your fix working in IE??
2013-12-31 09:51:26	kweaver	my webkit fix?
2013-12-31 09:51:43	kweaver	yaya, I actually only apply it to webkit browsers
2013-12-31 09:53:26	kweaver	and its basically just waiting until the slider init is complete, resetting the 3 thumbnail image widths, and re scanning it with my aspect ratio function
2013-12-31 09:53:27	jakenbake	yeah i saw that
2013-12-31 09:53:41	jakenbake	we should probably add opera to that mix
2013-12-31 09:53:51	kweaver	oh yeah
2013-12-31 09:53:59	jakenbake	i see you used the jsdoc
2013-12-31 09:54:12	kweaver	I was just going to see if you could add one if statement
2013-12-31 09:54:15	jakenbake	haha yo i was like oh clean up lemme see... WHAT 200 more lines!~
2013-12-31 09:54:25	kweaver	hahaha
2013-12-31 09:54:32	kweaver	yeah im gonna have tom use the same format
2013-12-31 09:55:54	kweaver	if its not too much trouble, could you just do an if to see if the slider has thumbnail-override set?
2013-12-31 09:56:14	kweaver	also did we come up with the term data-override or was that a plugin?
2013-12-31 09:56:15	jakenbake	it does
2013-12-31 09:56:28	jakenbake	data-override is for thumb overrides
2013-12-31 09:56:36	jakenbake	data- is whatever you want
2013-12-31 09:56:42	kweaver	ok
2013-12-31 09:56:49	jakenbake	theres a few ifs for the thumbnail override kweaver
2013-12-31 09:56:59	jakenbake	cause it needs it on build and on setting and whatnot
2013-12-31 09:57:05	jakenbake	is there something specific you need?
2013-12-31 09:57:07	kweaver	can you just throw an if around my fix call I mean
2013-12-31 09:57:19	kweaver	so that its only applied if the thumbnail override is set to on
2013-12-31 09:57:26	jakenbake	oooooh
2013-12-31 09:57:27	kweaver	just a small efficiency thing
2013-12-31 09:57:28	jakenbake	i gotchu
2013-12-31 09:57:30	jakenbake	yeah
2013-12-31 09:57:39	kweaver	since 95% of sliders probably wont have thumbnail override
2013-12-31 09:57:57	kweaver	gonna shower really quick and do my IE thing
2013-12-31 09:58:04	jakenbake	the webkit fix function?
2013-12-31 09:58:16	jakenbake	im gonna grab breakfast and then fix that nav bug
2013-12-31 09:59:17	kweaver	yeah ill give you a line #, sec
2013-12-31 10:01:55	jakenbake	already did it
2013-12-31 10:02:04	kweaver	delete my comments in line 938 and 939. those were there when I moved it into the function
2013-12-31 10:02:12	jakenbake	962
2013-12-31 10:02:22	kweaver	/loop through any slider
2013-12-31 10:02:28	kweaver	and  //OR DELETE THIS
2013-12-31 10:02:38	jakenbake	right
2013-12-31 10:02:43	jakenbake	and then add the check in 962
2013-12-31 10:02:48	kweaver	yeah
2013-12-31 10:02:51	jakenbake	so if its webkit and thumnail gen is off
2013-12-31 10:02:53	kweaver	just && it
2013-12-31 10:02:54	jakenbake	yep were good
2013-12-31 10:02:57	jakenbake	its done

2013-12-31 10:51:03	kweaver	magento didnt create an order or email him, and paypal just knows how much money and who
2013-12-31 10:51:11	kweaver	so we dont know what items
2013-12-31 10:51:42	jakenbake	on the first one we did?
2013-12-31 10:51:44	jakenbake	thats fucking odd

2013-12-31 10:55:37	kweaver	im destroying that site like next month
2013-12-31 10:56:21	kweaver	of course its not just a single item where I can compare it to the order number
2013-12-31 10:56:32	kweaver	and of course its not two of the same item
2013-12-31 11:04:30	jakenbake	thats shitty
2013-12-31 11:04:34	jakenbake	talked to dave about config

2013-12-31 11:19:32	jakenbake	kweaver: did you say you fixed the lazy load?

2013-12-31 13:09:31	kweaver	G+ real quick so we can discuss final steps
2013-12-31 14:00:52	kweaver	bleh
2013-12-31 14:02:45	kweaver	the fix is very easy, but I just need to check for IE8, which can't be done within a css file, only the usual html check <!--[if IE 8]>
2013-12-31 14:03:27	kweaver	but then ill have to put all the styling in the html as well since we arent allowed to use more than one css file
2013-12-31 14:04:41	kweaver	so ill probably have to add that to your init function to just generate the IE8 css inline
2013-12-31 14:16:41	kweaver	maybe not
2013-12-31 14:21:11	jakenbake	why not check for IE8 and if so add the appropriate class with important?
2013-12-31 14:21:16	jakenbake	kweaver: lazy load done
2013-12-31 14:21:51	kweaver	thats even smarter, you brave young man
2013-12-31 14:21:59	jakenbake	haha i gotchu
2013-12-31 14:22:03	kweaver	but I think I found a workaround instead
2013-12-31 14:22:08	kweaver	thats sick though
2013-12-31 14:22:13	jakenbake	i cant write the CSS.. but i sure know how to fucking avoid it
2013-12-31 14:22:19	kweaver	lol
2013-12-31 14:22:32	jakenbake	yeah i had to tweak some shit with what was there
2013-12-31 14:22:37	jakenbake	but its most def lazy loading
2013-12-31 14:22:44	jakenbake	and wont try to reload it if already done
2013-12-31 14:22:52	kweaver	fuck
2013-12-31 14:22:56	kweaver	found a nav bug jakenbake 
2013-12-31 14:22:58	kweaver	:(
2013-12-31 14:23:01	jakenbake	no you didnt
2013-12-31 14:23:03	jakenbake	fuck off
2013-12-31 14:23:09	jakenbake	lol what is it
2013-12-31 14:23:11	kweaver	as soon as you thought you were done
2013-12-31 14:23:20	kweaver	go to slide 3
2013-12-31 14:23:23	kweaver	nav right
2013-12-31 14:23:26	kweaver	slide right
2013-12-31 14:24:40	kweaver	same with going to the left-most slide in a set
2013-12-31 14:24:45	kweaver	naving left, then sliding left
2013-12-31 14:25:26	jakenbake	yeah i know wht it is
2013-12-31 14:25:34	jakenbake	its why i didnt have this set up the way it is now
2013-12-31 14:25:40	jakenbake	we got so caught up testing the hard
2013-12-31 14:25:45	jakenbake	we forgot the easy
2013-12-31 14:25:49	kweaver	ok
2013-12-31 14:26:29	kweaver	is that a good thing or a bad thing?

2013-12-31 14:50:40	kweaver	yeah yeah thats what they all say
2013-12-31 14:51:00	kweaver	i found this workaround for ie8 and background-size
2013-12-31 14:51:00	jakenbake	hows your hax coming
2013-12-31 14:51:08	kweaver	but its just overlaying it twice now..
2013-12-31 14:51:14	kweaver	broken and less broken
2013-12-31 14:51:21	kweaver	so i might just do the class thing
2013-12-31 14:51:37	kweaver	its only play, logo and 4 navs
2013-12-31 14:51:44	kweaver	all the same fix

2013-12-31 15:51:49	jakenbake	the actual css or applying it?
2013-12-31 15:51:55	kweaver	but the butt is the actual css

2013-12-31 15:56:10	kweaver	maybe i should just grab something else little from somewhere
2013-12-31 15:56:19	kweaver	and we'll split it 5 ways (with danielle too)
2013-12-31 15:57:12	kweaver	i dont think anyone is bringing any actual food items, so maybe some sort of smallish, actual food item tray
2013-12-31 16:09:17	jakenbake	we wont be getting a tray of actual food from anywhere

2013-12-31 17:50:06	kweaver	looks good though
2013-12-31 17:51:23	kweaver	it sucks that this project didnt have us built something that we could use for ourselves too
2013-12-31 17:51:25	kweaver	haha
2013-12-31 17:51:32	kweaver	I assume most wont
2013-12-31 17:52:10	kweaver	but it still would have been nice if it was a cooler javascript plugin
2013-12-31 17:53:05	jakenbake	yeah most definitely
2013-12-31 17:53:19	jakenbake	although im pretty confident with dom manipulation and pure js now
2013-12-31 17:53:28	jakenbake	so maybe we can build shit wed need if a client needed it
2013-12-31 17:53:40	kweaver	yeah def
2013-12-31 18:12:29	kweaver	jakenbake: renamed our How To folder Client Documentation

2014-01-03 11:54:32	jakenbake	kweaver:  "yeah thats bad, background-size is supported by IE9 only "

2014-01-03 11:57:41	jakenbake	jesus
2014-01-03 11:58:17	jakenbake	nevermind
2014-01-03 11:58:21	jakenbake	its to remove the filter
2014-01-03 11:58:29	kweaver	bleh
2014-01-03 12:01:15	kweaver	jakenbake the filters just arent doing anything
2014-01-03 12:01:34	kweaver	my classes also change height and stuff
2014-01-03 12:01:43	kweaver	they are all that is actually being applied
2014-01-03 12:03:51	kweaver	like I just commented out all of the filters, theyre doing nothing
2014-01-03 12:09:57	jakenbake	It is treated like an image element and not a CSS background-image, so it loses CSS properties like background-position and background-repeat. Also, it's src is relative to the current HTML document unlike a CSS background-image which path is relative to the CSS document.
2014-01-03 12:10:00	jakenbake	boom
2014-01-03 12:10:08	jakenbake	only with microsoft
2014-01-03 12:10:11	jakenbake	could that happen
2014-01-03 12:11:17	kweaver	ughhh
2014-01-03 12:11:20	kweaver	alright
2014-01-03 12:11:23	kweaver	well that answers that
2014-01-03 12:12:06	kweaver	so now we have to write some javascript to find those images and append that css to the ie8 fix elements
2014-01-03 12:12:16	jakenbake	kweaver: http://www.jacklmoore.com/notes/ie-transparency-problems/
2014-01-03 12:12:25	jakenbake	can the first fix work for you?
2014-01-03 12:12:35	jakenbake	by using a gradient that doesnt actually do anything?
2014-01-03 12:13:35	kweaver	ill try, but i dont think so.  our issue is the fact that the css is looking in the wrong place for those iamges
2014-01-03 12:13:48	jakenbake	also say we have shit monday. if he wants to keep dodging calls were not gonna fucking cater to him
2014-01-03 12:13:59	jakenbake	well if thats the one issue, lets hardcode it first
2014-01-03 12:14:03	jakenbake	and see what happens
2014-01-03 12:14:15	kweaver	also, we still have to replace his site and logo
2014-01-03 12:15:46	jakenbake	oh fuck hahahah

2014-01-03 12:20:47	jakenbake	kweaver: http://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/  method 2?
2014-01-03 12:20:49	jakenbake	maybe?
2014-01-03 12:21:23	jakenbake	it fucks with aspect ratio and shit
2014-01-03 12:21:25	jakenbake	so probably not

2014-01-03 12:45:07	jakenbake	i did find one bug in it kweaver
2014-01-03 12:45:11	kweaver	i saw
2014-01-03 12:45:27	jakenbake	but its the only one i found
2014-01-03 12:45:37	jakenbake	probably simple, but if he doesnt have time to fix it im sure i can find it
2014-01-03 12:46:56	kweaver	I plotted a point that was prior to all other points in the grph and initially it didnt work
2014-01-03 12:47:02	kweaver	but now it does
2014-01-03 12:47:08	jakenbake	ie8?
2014-01-03 12:47:09	kweaver	so maybe it was out of bounds and didnt tell me
2014-01-03 12:47:13	kweaver	nah just chrome
2014-01-03 12:47:15	jakenbake	cause hes got console logs in as well
2014-01-03 12:47:17	jakenbake	oh okay
2014-01-03 12:47:20	kweaver	anyway
2014-01-03 12:47:31	kweaver	i put an absolute path in the filter and it worked fine
2014-01-03 12:48:34	jakenbake	word?
2014-01-03 12:48:40	jakenbake	so we just have to get the path appropriately then?
2014-01-03 12:48:46	jakenbake	sorry i just went on a mad google hunt
2014-01-03 12:48:54	kweaver	yeah 
2014-01-03 12:48:56	jakenbake	but other than that, were good? also that explains the crash
2014-01-03 12:48:58	kweaver	just trying to figure out how now
2014-01-03 12:49:03	kweaver	it does?
2014-01-03 12:49:06	jakenbake	cause it was transforming something that didnt exist
2014-01-03 12:49:08	jakenbake	yeah
2014-01-03 12:49:10	kweaver	ohhh
2014-01-03 12:49:11	jakenbake	what it wanted
2014-01-03 12:49:12	jakenbake	wasnt in the dom
2014-01-03 12:49:15	kweaver	ok
2014-01-03 12:49:22	kweaver	fuck you microsoft
2014-01-03 12:49:50	jakenbake	lol what not?
2014-01-03 12:49:52	jakenbake	now*
2014-01-03 12:49:56	kweaver	nah
2014-01-03 12:49:58	kweaver	just that issue
2014-01-03 12:50:05	jakenbake	yeah. seriously though
2014-01-03 12:50:14	kweaver	because they wanted filter to take urls differently
2014-01-03 12:50:17	kweaver	that doesnt make
2014-01-03 12:50:18	kweaver	any sense
2014-01-03 12:50:22	jakenbake	i feel like MS is the king of workarounds. they write workarounds internally
2014-01-03 12:50:30	kweaver	yeah exactly
2014-01-03 12:50:34	jakenbake	and then everyone else has to deal cause they get shipped to production
2014-01-03 12:50:59	kweaver	they have to have 8th graders working there
2014-01-03 12:51:50	kweaver	since I signed off, i lost what you said earlier about filter paths
2014-01-03 12:52:03	kweaver	can you paste it again?
2014-01-03 12:52:23	jakenbake	yeah
2014-01-03 12:52:38	jakenbake	It is treated like an image element and not a CSS background-image, so it loses CSS properties like background-position and background-repeat. Also, it's src is relative to the current HTML document unlike a CSS background-image which path is relative to the CSS document.
2014-01-03 12:53:43	kweaver	got it
2014-01-03 12:53:53	kweaver	so its literally just, remove the "../" from it
2014-01-03 12:54:00	kweaver	from every image
2014-01-03 12:54:27	jakenbake	uh yes
2014-01-03 12:55:52	jakenbake	if were actually done this. im all for helping tom in whatever way i can to get this shipped

2014-01-03 13:03:37	jakenbake	the actual MSDN page (microsoft not moz. on the fucking filter) does not even say that
2014-01-03 13:06:03	kweaver	good news is that licensee and mobile look ready to roll
2014-01-03 13:06:13	kweaver	bad news is mothership keeps crashing so i cant see it

2014-01-03 14:31:44	kweaver	he didnt answer
2014-01-03 14:32:02	kweaver	and their site has wayyyyy more functionality than s imple $3k-5k
2014-01-03 14:32:05	kweaver	simple**
2014-01-03 14:32:49	kweaver	they have user accounts, donation form, grant application, an in depth calendar, this weird eCard generator to send people eCards
2014-01-03 14:33:23	kweaver	the user accounts store security questions, user address/info, newsletter preference
2014-01-03 14:34:02	kweaver	so yet again, brian has set their expectations through the floor, and we get to sound like the dumbies
2014-01-03 14:34:14	jakenbake	ugh yeah thats really shitty
2014-01-03 14:34:31	jakenbake	well i dont have a 1k ping. so im back to productive
2014-01-03 14:34:46	jakenbake	so, they presumably have SSL and some other extensive shit going on
2014-01-03 14:35:02	jakenbake	i mean for 5k we could squeeze it. if nothing else came up, but really i dont think itd be owrth it
2014-01-03 14:35:18	kweaver	the weird eCard generator would probably just have to go

2014-01-03 14:37:08	kweaverTop	they also have this national directory: http://jewishbytheshore.org/Section.aspx?ID=5
2014-01-03 14:37:25	kweaverTop	if we would have shown this site to me just once I would have told him $5k+
2014-01-03 14:37:26	jakenbake	well i think the biggest thing about the port is right there
2014-01-03 14:37:28	jakenbake	aspx
2014-01-03 14:37:30	jakenbake	boom
2014-01-03 14:37:35	jakenbake	full rewrite

2014-01-03 14:38:57	kweaverTop	dude click in that directory
2014-01-03 14:39:32	kweaverTop	click around in there
2014-01-03 14:39:44	kweaverTop	recreating that would be like 600+ pages alone
2014-01-03 14:40:05	kweaverTop	plus its sorted by state
2014-01-03 14:40:24	jakenbake	yeah its fucking huge
2014-01-03 14:40:34	jakenbake	man i thought he mighta done okay with 3k - 5k

2014-01-03 14:40:59	jakenbake	this is a 10k site
2014-01-03 14:41:05	kweaverTop	to recreate this site as a full port from asp to a wordpress or drupal site without cutting anything is $10k+
2014-01-03 14:41:20	jakenbake	this would most liekly have to be drupal
2014-01-03 14:44:44	kweaverTop	yeah it would
2014-01-03 14:44:59	kweaverTop	just the national directory alone
2014-01-03 14:46:00	jakenbake	its entirely too custom to be wordpress unless we wrote a whole plugin

2014-01-03 18:35:47	kweaver	i made a file called measurements.html to show tom exactly the html that I wanted for the print.  he already has a function that appends all of it, but I made some changes to the html
2014-01-03 18:35:55	kweaver	so you need to go into his function and update it
2014-01-03 18:35:59	kweaver	almost done

2014-01-03 18:45:59	kweaver	he already has appending finished, you just need to change around some class names
2014-01-03 18:46:36	kweaver	he said that he appended that class description with the paragraphs, but i didnt notice it in there, so you might need to append that text too
2014-01-03 18:47:41	kweaver	youll also need to add some strong tags.  youll see them though
2014-01-03 18:47:42	kweaver	brb

2014-01-08 17:22:22	kweaver	too often I've seen business trying to save every possible cent they can, and end up spending way more in the process

2014-01-08 17:29:01	jakenbake	totally thought you were sending hangouts cause all my shit was rinigng but no notifications on any pc
2014-01-08 17:29:08	jakenbake	and then fucking couldnt do anything when i clicked on you
2014-01-08 17:29:15	jakenbake	no indication of anything else antqhere
2014-01-08 17:29:22	kweaver	of course
2014-01-08 17:29:44	kweaver	well I dont mind seeing their place, but I also dont want it to turn into a thing right from the first check
2014-01-08 17:30:13	kweaver	I dunno, maybe we should just swing by and meet everyone
2014-01-08 17:30:43	kweaver	they seem like they have money and potential.  we could probably spare a couple hours and start to establish that relationship
2014-01-08 17:31:24	jakenbake	yeah its probably good to meet them all once
2014-01-08 17:31:31	kweaver	you wanna ask if theres a time/day that would be less busy so we can swing by and meet everyone
2014-01-08 17:31:33	jakenbake	put my dick on their counter
2014-01-08 17:31:40	kweaver	yeah exactly
2014-01-08 17:32:07	kweaver	ive got like 10 black jokes for wendiezel
2014-01-08 17:32:21	jakenbake	seriously
2014-01-08 17:32:33	jakenbake	omg.. is he our first black client?
2014-01-08 17:32:40	kweaver	hahahaha
2014-01-08 17:32:41	kweaver	I think so
2014-01-08 17:32:53	jakenbake	sheeeeeet
2014-01-08 17:32:57	kweaver	unless maybe....  mark maraist is an albino never nude
2014-01-08 17:33:11	jakenbake	anyways im gonna email chris and brandon about their email pricing and making sure it has a catch all
2014-01-08 17:33:35	kweaver	yeah sounds good.  just cc me, not matt
2014-01-08 17:33:42	kweaver	we'll talk to matt when its done
2014-01-08 17:34:06	jakenbake	yeah had no intentions of having matt in the conversation
2014-01-08 17:34:10	jakenbake	like youre a fucking dentist
2014-01-08 17:34:13	jakenbake	i know you guys have the money
2014-01-08 17:35:00	kweaver	and its not even one.  dude owns a chain of them.  I think he can afford real email
2014-01-08 17:35:48	kweaver	this might not be fair.. but I still blame bflaim.  He started this entire conversation off on the bare bones low end for no reason
2014-01-08 17:36:13	kweaver	dudes could have potentially been one of our bigger clients
2014-01-08 17:40:02	jakenbake	yeah it really couldbe
2014-01-08 17:40:08	jakenbake	5 or 6 dental offices
2014-01-08 17:40:15	jakenbake	opening a fucking online distribution network
2014-01-08 17:40:18	jakenbake	i think they have cash
2014-01-08 17:40:25	jakenbake	bflaim said he wrote what, a check for 60k?
2014-01-08 17:40:30	jakenbake	for the half of the year?
2014-01-08 17:40:39	kweaver	yeah
2014-01-08 17:40:47	kweaver	we definitely got shafted there
2014-01-08 17:41:17	jakenbake	120k / year... site will be 4 - 6k and 300 yearly
2014-01-08 17:41:19	jakenbake	lolol
2014-01-08 17:41:25	jakenbake	coulda been a solid 10-15k
2014-01-08 17:42:33	kweaver	that was still the earlier days so we cant be too pissed.  even though brian still has a fascination with ballparking everything himself, I think hes slowly beginning to understand the time investment
2014-01-08 17:42:57	jakenbake	yeah i think weve got a much better handle on pricing
2014-01-08 17:43:01	jakenbake	like holdbrook is great for us
2014-01-08 17:43:03	jakenbake	good rate for us and them
2014-01-08 17:43:10	jakenbake	but tenbrook coulda been better
2014-01-08 17:43:15	kweaver	yeah def
2014-01-08 17:43:16	jakenbake	GTA was probably in the right ballpark
2014-01-08 17:43:22	jakenbake	nemours is/was fucking perfect
2014-01-08 17:43:28	jakenbake	really hoping we get another project
2014-01-08 17:43:29	kweaver	you still not feelin peebs?
2014-01-08 17:43:35	kweaver	I think jeff should be home soon
2014-01-08 17:43:41	kweaver	Ill probably head out shortly
2014-01-08 17:44:05	kweaver	actually he just called
2014-01-08 17:44:11	kweaver	hes swinging by to grab me

2014-01-15 16:27:01	kweaver	just talked to stacey jakenbake.  pretty brief since she was actually on vacation during the incident.  I wrote up some notes in their client notes.  she did, however, forward me the server logs that Creative gave them.  I put them in /Client Notes/Katz_JCC_access_log.txt
2014-01-15 16:27:38	kweaver	creative said that all of the internal IPs became black listed
2014-01-15 16:27:45	kweaver	thats what happened with flanders twice
2014-01-15 16:30:23	jakenbake	lol who runs these servers
2014-01-15 16:30:45	kweaver	company called creative
2014-01-15 16:31:25	jakenbake	and who runs their internal networks
2014-01-15 16:31:28	kweaver	but apparently, there is another company called Enom, that also has access to them.  while the sites were down internally, they contacted Enom to troubleshoot the situation
2014-01-15 16:31:30	jakenbake	one of the two are at fault
2014-01-15 16:31:41	kweaver	enom could be the internal guys
2014-01-15 16:31:46	kweaver	im not sure exactly
2014-01-15 16:32:30	kweaver	and by internal, i mean runs the internal network
2014-01-15 16:34:07	kweaver	im writting up and email between you, me, chris, brandon with all of the info that we know
2014-01-15 16:34:14	kweaver	and to see what they think
2014-01-15 16:36:29	jakenbake	imma look at the logs
2014-01-15 16:40:39	jakenbake	lmao
2014-01-15 16:40:42	jakenbake	is creative a real company
2014-01-15 16:40:47	jakenbake	they literally sent them access logs
2014-01-15 16:40:53	jakenbake	like literal apache access logs
2014-01-15 16:41:07	jakenbake	so it shows all successful accesses to the site through fucking apache
2014-01-15 16:41:09	jakenbake	not error logs
2014-01-15 16:41:12	jakenbake	not warnings
2014-01-15 16:41:14	jakenbake	jesus fucking christ
2014-01-15 16:43:51	jakenbake	kweaver: that log is absolutely useless and creative sent it because either A) theyre just as useless or B) they are sending them knowing no one at katz jcc can do anything with it
2014-01-15 16:46:39	kweaver	hahahaha
2014-01-15 16:46:42	kweaver	thats hilarious
2014-01-15 16:46:53	kweaver	i just look at it
2014-01-15 16:48:58	kweaver	so when the flanders network ip was blacklisted twice
2014-01-15 16:49:09	kweaver	one time it was because someone failed to log in 20 times
2014-01-15 16:49:35	kweaver	the other time, one of their email accounts was spamming emails for some reason
2014-01-15 16:49:49	jakenbake	well apache logs.. access logs for that matter
2014-01-15 16:49:51	jakenbake	do one thing
2014-01-15 16:49:55	jakenbake	show successful requests
2014-01-15 16:50:12	jakenbake	for them to be banned for failed logins would be by creative
2014-01-15 16:50:14	jakenbake	not internal
2014-01-15 16:50:34	jakenbake	and for internal ban out there, could be spam, but not likely
2014-01-15 16:51:01	kweaver	if it was related to the store, it could have been the fact that the store was set to send emails as kathy.  and maybe when kathy tried to buy store items from kathy, kathy started spamming herself
2014-01-15 16:51:05	jakenbake	unless the spam was going from and to katzjcc domains, therefore their internal network was getting spammed by the external mail server
2014-01-15 16:55:14	kweaver	basically, im just going to tell them that if creative doesnt know the difference between access logs and error logs, then it is probably important for them to consider leaving their hosting, regardless of who the move to
2014-01-15 16:55:52	jakenbake	i mean thats a valid statment
2014-01-15 16:55:59	jakenbake	cause its only A or B above
2014-01-15 16:56:00	jakenbake	thats it
2014-01-15 16:56:27	kweaver	so ill tell them, since we dont have access to the server, it will make more sense to just do the transfer first, and then once it's on our server, we can work on bringing the store back online in a way that wont bring the site down internally
2014-01-15 16:56:38	jakenbake	yo kweaver do you think your dad will mind if we do the prices in the AM?  i dont think ive got the energy for some focus on tedious shit, was just gonna test out my fixes on nemours
2014-01-15 16:56:54	jakenbake	i mean its totally valid
2014-01-15 16:56:59	jakenbake	without access to their internal config though
2014-01-15 16:57:04	jakenbake	we dont know if its an internal block
2014-01-15 16:57:18	jakenbake	but it doesnt change the fact that creative is either incompetent or trying to pull the wool over on them
2014-01-15 16:57:36	kweaver	yeah thats fine

2014-01-15 18:16:51	kweaver	you sign in, and then it takes you to an broken, offcentered iframe. and when you adjust the clientside width of the iframe, you see that its actually just another sign in page that doesnt nothing when you sign in
2014-01-15 18:16:57	jakenbake	lmao.  yeah id have to get my moms email and password if we still have it
2014-01-15 18:17:04	jakenbake	haha

2014-01-15 18:20:29	kweaver	it worked fine on the android app
2014-01-15 18:20:45	kweaver	well if it turns out you dont have it, ill test it out on multiple devices first

2014-01-15 18:22:16	jakenbake	pimp. ill check and see again as well
2014-01-15 18:52:22	kweaver	jakenbake: got a bunch of kcups to bring tomorrow.  
2014-01-15 18:53:10	kweaver	we could probably also grab cream to label and throw in the fridge if we wanted
2014-01-15 18:56:10	jakenbake	i think youre jumpin on the office thing too hard
2014-01-15 18:56:15	jakenbake	we dont want it to become a thing for bc
2014-01-15 18:56:21	jakenbake	im all for having the cups and shit though
2014-01-15 18:56:47	kweaver	yeah i bought kcups for home too
2014-01-15 18:56:53	jakenbake	just dont wanna be there like 5 days in a row and then all of a sudden its 'wtf youre not in the office'
2014-01-15 18:56:57	jakenbake	and then its all weird
2014-01-15 18:57:01	jakenbake	and were not wearing pants
2014-01-15 18:57:07	kweaver	yeah true

2014-01-15 18:57:31	jakenbake	nah i dont think we will either
2014-01-15 18:57:36	kweaver	and if it did ever happen and they wanted a desk, we just hop over to bradm
2014-01-15 18:57:44	jakenbake	i just mean in terms of them sending someone or phones
2014-01-15 19:00:04	kweaver	brb
2014-01-15 19:04:57	kweaver	jakenbake, next check, we should set asside like $100 in the biz account and start putting all of our wawa coffee on the amex
2014-01-15 19:05:09	kweaver	i know its little, but we might as well so that its not always you paying
2014-01-15 19:06:02	jakenbake	its a smart idea
2014-01-15 19:08:40	jakenbake	so firefox mobile works great. cant get swipe on chrome mobile and sometimes on browser
2014-01-15 19:08:46	jakenbake	but i locked it in place like they had asked
2014-01-15 19:13:05	jakenbake	does look fine enough in browserstack until my sister gives me a real ios device to tesst

2014-10-15 10:37:23	jharty	anyways, few emails to finish up. then getting kirks coming soon done, finishing the content he gave me, and launching his coming soon

2014-10-15 10:37:38	kweaver	any updates from eirc?
2014-10-15 10:37:46	jharty	no response yet
2014-10-15 10:37:54	jharty	oh they left bc months ago
2014-10-15 10:39:15	kweaver	oh
2014-10-15 10:39:18	kweaver	thats why then
2014-10-15 10:39:28	kweaver	well, it doesnt have to be why
2014-10-15 10:40:18	kweaver	but i can see someone like doug thinking that theyd benefit from switching everything IT/website/electronics/nick-nack related all at the same time
2014-10-15 10:40:28	jharty	absolutely
2014-10-15 10:40:48	jharty	chris even said hew was super volatile so it was good to go
2014-10-15 10:41:19	kweaver	yeah he did that bullshit with the angry email Tim CC a while back
2014-10-15 10:42:00	jharty	oh thats right
2014-10-15 10:43:31	kweaver	its interesting to see the full spectrum of client personalities
2014-10-15 10:44:04	kweaver	and important to be able to read the early signs of potential personality conflicts
2014-10-15 10:47:07	jharty	yeah it really is wild, i wonder how close we were to billing him again
2014-10-15 11:00:34	kweaver	probably very
2014-10-15 11:05:58	jharty	can you read alicias email real quick kweaver and confirm im not an idiot  -- no clue what the difference between sidebar and side nav is or how a massive amount of text goes into the sidebar
2014-10-15 11:35:29	kweaver	i will in a bit
2014-10-15 11:46:37	kweaver	jharty: when you talked to brian on monday, everything seemed pretty fine between us and bc, right?  i just wanted to make sure that this 'omni-bc separation' was strictly for easier client relations and didnt have any additional reasons
2014-10-15 11:46:58	jharty	if shit was fucked, they made no indication of it
2014-10-15 11:47:06	jharty	theyre generally pretty straight forward too
2014-10-15 11:47:09	kweaver	yeah i figured as much
2014-10-15 11:47:11	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-15 11:47:15	jharty	but i guess it wouldnt hurt to ask
2014-10-15 11:47:18	kweaver	they let us know when they arent happy
2014-10-15 11:47:31	jharty	yeah they tend to haha
2014-10-15 11:47:36	jharty	esp when its never our fault
2014-10-15 11:47:43	kweaver	im not too worried because the set up that we had really didnt even make sense to begin with
2014-10-15 11:47:47	kweaver	and just wasted justine's time
2014-10-15 11:48:18	jharty	yeah im not overly concerned, and at the end of the day, we wont change their minds regarless of their decision
2014-10-15 11:48:20	kweaver	and cost them money in taxes for income they werent even making
2014-10-15 11:48:22	jharty	we just get to ride it out
2014-10-15 11:49:06	jharty	yeah exactly, i mean sure we keep some of their clients happy, but could literally do the same thing, without any issues and save them money
2014-10-15 11:50:17	kweaver	i think the concept was probably just a tim idea to begin with.  something like "well, if these guys are getting all of our clients, then i at least want our name on the good ones".  just turned out to not be worth the trouble
2014-10-15 11:50:27	jharty	i saw tim for like 2 seconds walking away, he was hungover eating, and aparently there was a dui incident recently
2014-10-15 11:50:38	kweaver	oh shit
2014-10-15 11:50:38	jharty	so i dont think that was any indication of animosity
2014-10-15 11:50:53	kweaver	you think he got a dui?
2014-10-15 11:51:00	jharty	again these are the things they discuss in front of me, but without context
2014-10-15 11:51:10	jharty	wasnt gonna be all OH SO TIM GOT A DUI AND KENS GETTING FIRED?
2014-10-15 11:51:31	kweaver	yeah
2014-10-15 11:51:43	kweaver	aight well i told bruiz that ill have to meet with bc thursday or friday
2014-10-15 11:52:05	kweaver	so ill see which day is better with bc and go from there.  you have an issue with either day/times?
2014-10-15 11:52:08	jharty	id prefer fridizzle, unless it doesnt work out
2014-10-15 11:52:17	jharty	but thurs morning would be roughish
2014-10-15 11:52:19	kweaver	yeah im good with friday
2014-10-15 11:52:32	jharty	plsu, id like to make sure im good to go work wise
2014-10-15 11:52:45	jharty	so if it becomes this long thing im not stuck at bc where we never seem to get real shit done
2014-10-15 12:55:49	jharty	lemme know what you think of that email
2014-10-15 12:55:54	jharty	when you have a free minute
2014-10-15 12:56:02	jharty	iu think im nearing completion of kirks shit
2014-10-15 13:13:49	kweaver	i think in alicia's email, shes saying that they want specific sidebars for specific pages
2014-10-15 13:14:43	kweaver	so on service page A, they'll show service B, C, and D.    but on service page E, they'll show service F, G, and H
2014-10-15 13:15:42	jharty	yeah i get that, but if you look at her attachments
2014-10-15 13:15:46	jharty	its a fucking page of text
2014-10-15 13:15:49	jharty	its not sidebar content
2014-10-15 13:15:56	kweaver	yeah im looking now.  yeah that doesnt make sense
2014-10-15 13:16:02	kweaver	you might want to clarify with her then
2014-10-15 13:16:31	kweaver	and let her know that if she actually meant 'sidebar' then the page would be 10 minutes long, and the page body would be 95% empty
2014-10-15 13:17:01	jharty	yeah i just wanted to make sure i was reading everything right before callin her out
2014-10-15 13:17:15	kweaver	slam her to the ground
2014-10-15 13:17:18	kweaver	and tell her no
2014-10-15 13:17:29	jharty	THATS NOT A SIDEBAR, THATS A CELL PHONE
2014-10-15 13:17:44	kweaver	hahaha
2014-10-15 13:19:43	jharty	ill reach out after i eat, finishin up kirks shit then noms

2014-10-20 10:48:08	jhartigan	yeah im comparing it.. doesnt make sense ill have to recreate
2014-10-20 10:57:14	kweaver	if its not already there, you might want to grab that post/page duplicate plugin jhartigan 
2014-10-20 10:57:58	jhartigan	doesnt work anyway still broken on dupe have to recreate and hope it works

2014-10-20 13:31:28	kweaver	k
2014-10-20 13:32:21	kweaver	it is likely that they will pick a paid solution, and during the last one they asked if we could pay it and add the amount to the yearly invoice
2014-10-20 13:32:30	kweaver	youll also need to throw an ssl on there
2014-10-20 13:32:38	kweaver	yearly/monthly invoice rather*
2014-10-20 13:33:02	kweaver	they never specified which, though you should push them to monthly.  especially since we will be interacting with them directly as omni soon

2014-10-23 12:42:46	jhartigan	kweaver: we dont have an example csv yet, just hthe db right?
2014-10-23 13:26:03	kweaver	nah i figured once you show them the dashboard tomorrow, ask if we have all the right buttons planned for and then ask them for access to a test db
2014-10-23 13:26:28	kweaver	actually we'll need the test csv too
2014-10-23 13:26:48	kweaver	pj did send one excell file
2014-10-23 13:27:10	kweaver	ill have to look at it tonight.  i dunno if it was meant to be used to data though

2014-10-23 14:41:57	jhartigan	kweaver: should i tell brian im not for the life of me going to their office for minimum 4 hours of my time to explain wordpress
2014-10-23 14:42:05	jhartigan	i have too much todo to go give lessons to kirk and becky
2014-10-23 14:42:26	jhartigan	ill screenshare with them but unless they pay, im not going to margate
2014-10-23 14:51:14	kweaver	das fine, as long as you word that the right way, i dont think he'll mind
2014-10-23 14:51:46	kweaver	you really dont have to go down there, so them asking you to is just kirk not knowing about screensharing
2014-10-23 14:53:59	kweaver	i also think we need to start setting different rates for going somewhere for stuff like that
2014-10-23 14:54:23	kweaver	a meeting about a potential project is one thing
2014-10-23 14:54:34	jhartigan	yeah i agree
2014-10-23 14:54:43	kweaver	but for existing clients wanting to learn how to use their site, it shouldnt be the same rate as an update
2014-10-23 14:54:45	jhartigan	i have martines address so im gonna mail them a fuckin invoice
2014-10-23 14:54:58	kweaver	it should be like $100-120/hr
2014-10-23 14:55:05	jhartigan	also i guess we never set up their VM shit
2014-10-23 14:55:12	jhartigan	cause... its not on there, waiting on ken
2014-10-23 14:55:24	kweaver	oh yeah
2014-10-23 14:55:33	jhartigan	so now that my days been sufficiently interrupted by kjcc and jccma
2014-10-23 14:55:42	jhartigan	im back to le graphs
2014-10-23 14:56:04	kweaver	i pushed a small update to the repo last night, but also have the dashboard mostly mocked up in photoshop
2014-10-23 14:56:19	jhartigan	yeah i pulled
2014-10-23 14:56:21	jhartigan	so
2014-10-23 14:56:23	jhartigan	d3 is reallly really cool
2014-10-23 14:56:31	jhartigan	has a .csv and .tsv function
2014-10-23 14:56:32	kweaver	by the end of tonight ill have the photoshop mockup done and in html/css
2014-10-23 14:56:39	jhartigan	built in reading of csv and tsv files
2014-10-23 14:56:48	kweaver	nice
2014-10-23 14:56:51	jhartigan	so i was wonering if we had any actual csvs or just the export
2014-10-23 14:56:57	jhartigan	cause i have a demo tsv in mine
2014-10-23 14:57:24	kweaver	well see if you can get the graph up with zoom and stuff with some demo data
2014-10-23 14:57:39	kweaver	for my graph i just made some example longtail
2014-10-23 14:59:35	jhartigan	yeah im gonna find a demo csv instead of this tsv
2014-10-23 14:59:43	jhartigan	use that and get responsive and zoom working
2014-10-23 15:00:52	kweaver	i know they offered to pay us more if the graph is responsive, but i figure we'll just see if it actually causes any issues down the road before taking up their offer
2014-10-23 15:01:43	kweaver	like if responsiveness becomes an issues with 10k results or we hit some unforseen circumstances and have to go out of our way, then i have no problem asking for more
2014-10-23 15:01:53	kweaver	but i dont see that being a likely scenario
2014-10-23 15:11:51	jhartigan	well responsive graphs are all math
2014-10-23 15:11:59	jhartigan	so long as we have a min and max scale
2014-10-23 15:12:01	jhartigan	i can do it
2014-10-23 15:12:04	jhartigan	at least from what ive read
2014-10-23 15:12:32	jhartigan	today im gonna do a shitload of learning and then tomorrow i think lay into a full fledged responsive bar graph
2014-10-23 15:12:38	jhartigan	with sort from highest > lowest
2014-10-23 15:12:40	jhartigan	then add zoom
2014-10-23 15:12:44	jhartigan	sound smartt?
2014-10-23 15:13:18	jhartigan	i dont wanna dive in and struggle, for an hour and a half since i htink were going to tmo tonight so ill get some more d3 learning on
2014-10-23 15:13:30	kweaver	tmo?
2014-10-23 15:13:34	kweaver	soudns good

2014-10-23 15:15:39	jhartigan	tmobile
2014-10-23 15:16:01	jhartigan	also kweaver i dont know if you filled in any data manually - not sure why i got that nan bug on that graph - but did you see what it looked like?
2014-10-23 15:16:18	jhartigan	basically the entire graphs are svg, which means we get total design control in CSS
2014-10-23 15:16:29	jhartigan	so between setting scale and CSS responsive shouldnt be a problem
2014-10-23 15:18:03	kweaver_desktop	yeah im not worried about responsive being an issue.  just another case of 'if it takes more than 2 minutes, then we can talk about adding additional budget for it'
2014-10-23 15:18:34	kweaver_desktop	i dunno if you played with the amchart one at all
2014-10-23 15:18:42	kweaver_desktop	but they do a really nice job of responsiveness
2014-10-23 15:18:46	jhartigan	i did, my biggest gripe, and you might not of noticed it
2014-10-23 15:18:50	jhartigan	its not efficent
2014-10-23 15:18:52	jhartigan	at all
2014-10-23 15:18:54	jhartigan	but it def works
2014-10-23 15:18:56	jhartigan	but on my chromebook
2014-10-23 15:19:01	jhartigan	fire and brimstone rain down
2014-10-23 15:19:04	kweaver_desktop	really?
2014-10-23 15:19:07	jhartigan	mhmm
2014-10-23 15:19:13	jhartigan	like crash and burn slow status
2014-10-23 15:19:19	kweaver_desktop	well that stinks
2014-10-23 15:19:25	jhartigan	yes and no
2014-10-23 15:19:25	kweaver_desktop	yeah i didnt have any efficiency issues
2014-10-23 15:19:35	jhartigan	for the most part.. i dont think that matters
2014-10-23 15:19:38	jhartigan	so if we wanna use that
2014-10-23 15:19:42	jhartigan	its not a huge deal
2014-10-23 15:19:47	jhartigan	but initial render, and resize
2014-10-23 15:19:51	jhartigan	shit hits the fan
2014-10-23 15:19:53	kweaver_desktop	well it all depends on how we render the full graph
2014-10-23 15:20:33	kweaver_desktop	i dont think we need to actually have 10k bars on one page.  i imagined the the full graph would almost be more of a summary-style line graph or something
2014-10-23 15:20:44	kweaver_desktop	and then loading only subsets with full data
2014-10-23 15:21:10	kweaver_desktop	in my example i think i only like like 200 bars
2014-10-23 15:21:21	kweaver_desktop	we will be looking at about 10k for theirs
2014-10-23 15:21:47	jhartigan	yeah, does it use SVG i didnt look
2014-10-23 15:22:03	jhartigan	but i wonder if thats a buff since its native browser, not JS drawing
2014-10-23 15:22:16	kweaver_desktop	i didnt look either. but it does give you a ton of control for them
2014-10-23 15:22:35	kweaver_desktop	http://live.amcharts.com/
2014-10-23 15:22:43	kweaver_desktop	they also have a cute little builder
2014-10-23 15:23:23	kweaver_desktop	you can save graph styles and publish them
2014-10-23 15:23:25	kweaver_desktop	http://live.amcharts.com/NkMmI/
2014-10-23 15:23:30	kweaver_desktop	thats the one i published
2014-10-23 15:24:28	jhartigan	yeah they use svgs too
2014-10-23 15:24:31	jhartigan	okay good
2014-10-23 15:24:35	jhartigan	so regardles scaling is basically the same
2014-10-23 15:24:43	jhartigan	we best use whats easiest
2014-10-23 15:25:04	jhartigan	im sur eyou havent looked, but any reservations about adjusting or extending am?
2014-10-23 15:25:14	kweaver_desktop	am?
2014-10-23 15:28:17	kweaver_desktop	avery merchant
2014-10-23 15:28:59	jhartigan	lol
2014-10-23 15:29:01	jhartigan	amcharts?
2014-10-23 15:30:04	kweaver_desktop	nah havent really looked, but it does seem very flexible from what ive seen
2014-10-23 15:30:25	kweaver_desktop	i figure we just get an equivilant zoom and responsiveness going for D3 and then make our final decision
2014-10-23 15:31:20	jhartigan	kk sounds good
2014-10-23 15:31:23	kweaver_desktop	and then by next week we get the csv and db access from dave and start going ham with one of them
2014-10-23 15:31:29	jhartigan	hoping kirk gets back to me tonight so i can finish this for real
2014-10-23 15:31:45	jhartigan	hes asking for more shit - dropped the scope creep hammer
2014-10-23 15:31:51	kweaver_desktop	nice
2014-10-23 15:31:55	kweaver_desktop	what was he asking for?
2014-10-23 15:32:25	kweaver_desktop	most powerful tool youve got as a hired developer
2014-10-23 15:32:53	jhartigan	well he already crept and in the interest of not hurting feelers i ported that random ass slew of content
2014-10-23 15:32:56	jhartigan	jewish 411
2014-10-23 15:33:00	jhartigan	but now hes like theres random spaces and shit
2014-10-23 15:33:16	kweaver_desktop	spaces from the content he gave you?
2014-10-23 15:33:44	jhartigan	yeah
2014-10-23 15:33:47	jhartigan	from the old site
2014-10-23 15:33:56	jhartigan	said if i were doing redesign work on it, id have to charge
2014-10-23 15:34:00	kweaver_desktop	yeah i would just tell him "well editing your own content sounds like a perfect opportunity for you to learn how to use the wordpress backend"
2014-10-23 15:35:07	jhartigan	yeah i mean this is the page i ported https://jewishbytheshore.org/jewish411/
2014-10-23 15:35:17	jhartigan	was not a copy pasta port
2014-10-23 15:35:28	jhartigan	but hes complaining about copypasta ports on other pages
2014-10-23 15:36:19	kweaver_desktop	yeah i would just framed it as a ' great and easy learning opportunity' for him
2014-10-23 15:36:36	kweaver_desktop	though we know how much he likes learning about applications
2014-10-23 15:37:01	jhartigan	yeah
2014-10-23 15:37:04	jhartigan	and im tired
2014-10-23 15:37:06	jhartigan	of him
2014-10-23 15:37:27	jhartigan	hes also slowly giving review changes, which after he approves what ive just done, and i get the VM creds from ken
2014-10-23 15:37:29	jhartigan	thats all done
2014-10-23 15:37:31	jhartigan	scope sealed
2014-10-23 15:37:56	kweaver_desktop	yeah just wrap this thang up the second you have that done
2014-10-23 15:39:31	kweaver_desktop	if he has other changes, just let him know youll be happy to do them at our hourly rate once the project gets paid.  i dont think he's dumb enough to try to argue that the project hasnt already gone months over the alotted time
2014-10-23 15:41:02	jhartigan	yeah he wont, i just want to make sure hes actually happy with what we told him hed get
2014-10-23 15:42:31	jhartigan	but hes basically gonna get to give me his approval / last slew of changes, and then I can call it a wrap, shess ssld, everythings been above and beyond on our end, regardless of him and well move on
2014-10-23 15:48:21	jhartigan	kweaver_desktop: omg we should material design this bitch
2014-10-23 15:48:25	jhartigan	its just so pretty
2014-10-23 15:52:10	kweaver_desktop	i was thinking about it
2014-10-23 15:52:18	kweaver_desktop	not a bad idea
2014-10-23 15:52:30	kweaver_desktop	ill show you the mockup i have once its done tonight
2014-10-23 15:52:39	jhartigan	trueconfessions: just saw swift key material design
2014-10-23 15:52:41	jhartigan	want gmails
2014-10-23 15:52:56	jhartigan	yeah im gonna finish this responsive and zoom readup
2014-10-23 15:52:58	kweaver_desktop	wouldnt be much work to also integrate the material design library
2014-10-23 16:26:43	kweaver_desktop	overall though jhartigan, i plan on blowing them away with the design on this one. pj likes us now, wait til he sees what we can do with a little design freedom
2014-10-23 16:35:12	jhartigan	yeah i think we shoul
2014-10-23 16:35:34	jhartigan	i think we should also extrapolate what the dataset is > separate processor > graph it
2014-10-23 16:35:40	jhartigan	we could potentially market it to others

2014-10-27 12:38:56	kweaver	dlenny asked a question
2014-10-27 12:39:02	kweaver	i dont remember the answer offhand
2014-10-27 12:39:26	kweaver	jhartigan: 
2014-10-27 12:40:07	jhartigan	no idea why. i just know it was a webkit issue
2014-10-27 12:40:18	jhartigan	katz is picky with the store
2014-10-27 12:40:27	jhartigan	also stephanie is hot
2014-10-27 12:42:46	jhartigan	kweaver: this camps guy seems to like creativ
2014-10-27 12:43:34	jhartigan	do we charge normal hosting to Katz, 300/domain?
2014-10-27 12:44:06	kweaver	correct, $300 per website
2014-10-27 12:44:16	kweaver	so they currently pay $600 for just the two sites
2014-10-27 12:44:19	jhartigan	yeah
2014-10-27 12:44:23	kweaver	when you switch camp over, itll be another $300
2014-10-27 12:44:36	jhartigan	if
2014-10-27 12:45:13	jhartigan	he wasnt overly happy when i said a direct clone of the camps with wordpress and mobile port would be substantially more costly than a new mobile ready site
2014-10-27 12:45:34	jhartigan	said creative was gonna do the wordpress port for him and i said thats fine if you think itll work out
2014-10-27 12:51:46	kweaver	did he say how much creative was gonna charge for it?
2014-10-27 12:52:30	jhartigan	nah he wanted to hear our bid
2014-10-27 12:52:48	jhartigan	i dont care, creative sucks and he wont be happy with it if they do it
2014-10-27 12:52:58	jhartigan	he joked about 15k for it
2014-10-27 12:53:16	jhartigan	i think im gonna telll him 12k, meanwhile 6k to use new theme
2014-10-27 12:53:43	kweaver	yeah thats reasonable
2014-10-27 12:53:55	kweaver	just make sure he knows that the 6k new site would like 60000000x better
2014-10-27 12:54:02	kweaver	and give examples
2014-10-27 12:58:37	jhartigan	oh i did
2014-10-27 12:58:43	jhartigan	he likkes his 10 year old site
2014-10-27 12:58:46	jhartigan	which in his defense
2014-10-27 12:58:52	jhartigan	doesnt remotely look 10 years old
2014-10-27 12:59:39	jhartigan	also stephanie is hot
2014-10-27 13:01:36	jhartigan	almost got another visit to the ER last night, but waited it out.  fucken like 0 sleep
2014-10-27 13:01:41	jhartigan	meeting went well overall htough
2014-10-27 13:03:15	kweaver	which stephanie?
2014-10-27 13:03:24	kweaver	isnt she the old one?
2014-10-27 13:03:39	jhartigan	no
2014-10-27 13:03:40	kweaver	theres too many people there, i cant keep track of everyone
2014-10-27 13:03:49	jhartigan	i thought she was older based on phone
2014-10-27 13:03:52	kweaver	how old is she?
2014-10-27 13:03:52	jhartigan	shes roughly our age
2014-10-27 13:03:54	jhartigan	black hair
2014-10-27 13:03:55	kweaver	oh damn
2014-10-27 13:04:02	kweaver	maybe i havent met her?
2014-10-27 13:04:05	jhartigan	sits behind arielle
2014-10-27 13:04:10	jhartigan	this was the first time i met her
2014-10-27 13:05:14	jhartigan	walked her through updates and she was like... omg this is so easy
2014-10-27 13:10:18	jhartigan	but yeah.. fuckin felt very heartattackish last night/early mornign, was not fun.  0/10 would not recommend
2014-10-27 13:38:58	kweaver	well that sucks
2014-10-27 13:39:21	kweaver	so then its official that your last surgery didnt fix it
2014-10-27 13:40:01	jhartigan	yeah i guess so
2014-10-27 13:40:17	jhartigan	this was weird, pains never severe and neither is the breathing shit
2014-10-27 13:40:27	jhartigan	but i went through literally every symptom of heartattack
2014-10-27 13:40:29	jhartigan	which worries me
2014-10-27 13:41:30	kweaver	yeah thats worrisome
2014-10-27 13:41:53	jhartigan	they all came and went but the pain remained a while
2014-10-27 13:41:58	jhartigan	and has come back a bit
2014-10-27 13:59:01	jhartigan	so i found something that fits all of my symptoms, to the t
2014-10-27 13:59:03	jhartigan	and is missed often
2014-10-27 13:59:07	jhartigan	because we vaccinate
2014-10-27 13:59:14	jhartigan	im on the high end of my vaccine reup
2014-10-27 14:16:11	kweaver	what is it
2014-10-27 14:18:23	jhartigan	diphtheria
2014-10-27 14:18:38	jhartigan	and according to my sister.. i wouldnt have gotten the vaccine i thought i wouldve
2014-10-27 14:18:42	jhartigan	the plot thickens
2014-10-27 14:21:13	jhartigan	wtf... why is tony setting me up on a call with their developer
2014-10-27 14:21:19	jhartigan	its cause hes getting fired
2014-10-27 14:22:07	kweaver	the def is getting fired?
2014-10-27 14:22:09	kweaver	dev*
2014-10-27 14:22:14	jhartigan	no tony
2014-10-27 14:22:18	jhartigan	tony and ken were the two
2014-10-27 14:22:52	kweaver	ken said that tony makes less sales than ken does, but tony also makes lese
2014-10-27 14:22:56	kweaver	less*
2014-10-27 14:23:17	jhartigan	tony said its a call with their dev.  im not taking a call to walk someone through a document because he cant implement a curl or whatever he needs to do
2014-10-27 14:23:46	kweaver	yeah just give him the developer url again and say thats all we can do
2014-10-27 14:23:56	kweaver	this is seriously deja vu
2014-10-27 14:24:11	kweaver	we've gotten to this point two other times
2014-10-27 14:24:16	jhartigan	im not even taking the call if he responds and says hes still working on the site
2014-10-27 14:24:30	jhartigan	if he wants me its gonna be 120$ since their dev needs a fucking consult
2014-10-27 14:26:32	jhartigan	120/hr
2014-10-27 14:26:56	kweaver	yeah def
2014-10-27 15:31:54	kweaver	i dont know why tony has had such a tough time grasping the situation enough to explain to the client well
2014-10-27 15:32:11	kweaver	its rather simple and ive told tony like 3 or 4 times
2014-10-27 15:32:41	jhartigan	yeah dude
2014-10-27 15:32:58	jhartigan	i might respond with, youre going to have to tell them i'm billing for my time in the cal
2014-10-27 15:33:06	jhartigan	a developer that cant handle an api
2014-10-27 15:33:10	jhartigan	isnt my problem
2014-10-27 15:33:52	kweaver	i would hear out the call first, just take 5 minutes to explain again and then offer them the option of setting up a paid call if they need help walking through the api
2014-10-27 15:34:13	jhartigan	thought about that
2014-10-27 15:34:18	jhartigan	then thought about how much i care
2014-10-27 15:34:20	jhartigan	its 0
2014-10-27 15:34:28	jhartigan	so money or no deal seems good to me
2014-10-27 15:34:32	jhartigan	its not my first call
2014-10-27 15:34:39	jhartigan	ive spoken to the agency and the dev
2014-10-27 15:34:45	jhartigan	and sent him the information
2014-10-27 15:35:25	kweaver	you know tony would then just forward the situation on to brian, who doesnt have a clue about any of whats going on
2014-10-27 15:35:57	kweaver	i dunno, i would personally just take 5 minutes and let them know that any future work on that client will have to be billed
2014-10-27 15:36:02	kweaver	to avoid a situation with bc
2014-10-27 15:36:11	jhartigan	i dont care if its a situation
2014-10-27 15:36:53	kweaver	well then thats up to you
2014-10-27 15:36:59	jhartigan	dude my days are emails and phone calls without wasting my time, let alone willingly adding a time waste.  im finishing shit up with EIRC stuff and still need time to work on nemours
2014-10-27 15:37:07	jhartigan	a situation is the least of my concern
2014-10-27 15:38:48	kweaver	its up to you, just keep in mind that a situation would be much more time consuming than a 5 minute call.  and during a time where we are still unsure of our true standings with bc, probably not wise
2014-10-27 15:39:18	jhartigan	helping tony close one deal has no bearing on our stance with bc
2014-10-27 15:39:28	jhartigan	hes digging up a client who hasnt moved in 9 months
2014-10-27 15:40:05	kweaver	but coming off like we dont feel like supporting bc's sales team would have a bearing
2014-10-27 15:40:25	jhartigan	this is the 4th time
2014-10-27 15:40:30	jhartigan	its not a lack of support
2014-10-27 15:56:11	jhartigan	no wonder tony cant close
2014-10-27 15:56:15	jhartigan	he doesnt fucking read
2014-10-27 16:01:01	jhartigan	oh kweaver is the new gmail inbox or is inbox separate and gmail is just redesigned and updated?
2014-10-27 17:13:27	kweaver	i think its pretty separate jhartigan 
2014-10-27 17:13:44	kweaver	you dont have a signup list, they just ask you to email some address if youre interested
2014-10-27 17:15:09	kweaver	so i emailed that address, and in case anyone ever actually reads those emails, i made sure to mention how bad google can be with product anouncements and user experience.  emailing a random message to a random address is stupid and unorganized.  just make a fuckin signup list like anyone else

2014-11-03 10:03:12	jhartigan	gonna give her till 15 and then call her
2014-11-03 10:03:17	jhartigan	actually no im not
2014-11-03 10:03:20	jhartigan	she didnt give me her number
2014-11-03 10:03:25	jhartigan	so ill email her
2014-11-03 10:03:50	kweaver	aight
2014-11-03 10:08:31	jhartigan	ugh i hope she doesnt rescheduleee
2014-11-03 10:08:37	jhartigan	i wwanna get this outta the way
2014-11-03 10:08:46	jhartigan	stupid dev meeting at 2
2014-11-03 10:15:28	jhartigan	whats up with ken kweaver did he bring up the KFED pin
2014-11-03 10:15:31	jhartigan	kfed
2014-11-03 10:15:33	jhartigan	lol
2014-11-03 10:16:33	kweaver	jhartigan: ken called and said he talked to becky from jfed margate.  she said they want someone to call and schedule a time to 'come down and show them how to use the website'.  I figure you should just let them know that if they want you to come down, youll have to bill for your time and time on the road. they probably just dont know about any screensharing solutions
2014-11-03 10:17:00	kweaver	so im sure if you told them that, theyd prefer to just use a screenshare
2014-11-03 10:17:35	kweaver	then he was complaining about how poorly bc handled their email switch
2014-11-03 10:18:55	jhartigan	well as i told them already
2014-11-03 10:19:01	jhartigan	im not doing that wihtout being paid
2014-11-03 10:19:49	jhartigan	and he still needs to give me a pin
2014-11-03 10:20:04	jhartigan	I walked becky through shit, as well as kirk, once in person once on the phone
2014-11-03 10:20:44	kweaver	das cool.  so yeah just call becky and let her know
2014-11-03 10:22:28	jhartigan	dudes havent even paid and id be asking them to pay up but i need that PIN before its technically done
2014-11-03 10:23:00	kweaver	i guess email ken
2014-11-03 10:24:10	jhartigan	i had, but if he lost it, makes sense
2014-11-03 10:24:59	jhartigan	so youre all good on your dads shit though?
2014-11-03 10:25:14	kweaver	yeah mostly
2014-11-03 10:25:33	kweaver	he just doesnt feel like doing his own store updates
2014-11-03 10:25:49	kweaver	so i have to keep telling him that these are things he shouldnt be waiting on me for
2014-11-03 10:26:47	jhartigan	i just feel like if there were redirects, nd one store
2014-11-03 10:26:49	jhartigan	he wouldnt hate it
2014-11-03 11:05:21	kweaver	jhartigan: whats your simple check deposit limit?
2014-11-03 11:05:36	kweaver	$3k?
2014-11-03 11:05:54	jhartigan	mines 3k yeah
2014-11-03 11:05:59	jhartigan	but dunno what yours is
2014-11-03 11:06:05	kweaver	just checking
2014-11-03 11:06:14	kweaver	heres there setup https://www.simple.com/policies/photo-check-deposit-limits
2014-11-03 11:06:33	kweaver	i have to deposit 5 checks to be allowed to deposit $3k
2014-11-03 11:06:40	kweaver	even $3k is kinda lame
2014-11-03 11:06:47	jhartigan	oh interesting
2014-11-03 11:06:49	jhartigan	yeah it really is
2014-11-03 11:06:58	jhartigan	if PNC didnt have a limit it wouldnt matter
2014-11-03 11:07:02	jhartigan	but its 5k/day
2014-11-03 11:07:04	kweaver	yeah

2014-11-04 15:12:09	jhartigan	yp just chillen, been doing a bunch of d3 work.. waiting for lori to call
2014-11-04 15:12:14	jhartigan	she said 130.....
2014-11-04 15:13:21	kweaver	gotcha
2014-11-04 15:14:00	kweaver	im replying to the KCC email. apparently all domains registered after January 1, 2014 have to verify the owner email address, or the domain will be shut down
2014-11-04 15:14:28	kweaver	the owner address was kingscustomclothiers@gmail.com, which nobody checks.  there were like 10 warning emails in there
2014-11-04 15:15:08	jhartigan	oh ufck interesting
2014-11-04 15:15:17	jhartigan	i completely forgot to relogin to the BC email
2014-11-04 15:17:21	jhartigan	so. is that a namecheap thing that does that?
2014-11-04 15:18:10	kweaver	ICANN mandates namecheap and everyone else to do that now
2014-11-04 15:18:31	kweaver	so namecheap was sending the emails, and took the site down
2014-11-04 15:18:55	jhartigan	very interesting... kinda dic, i mean generally that wouldnt happen, but i wonder why
2014-11-04 15:19:15	kweaver	As of January 1, 2014, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has mandated that all ICANN accredited registrars begin verifying the WHOIS contact information for all new domain registrations and Registrant contact modifications.
2014-11-04 15:19:22	kweaver	its just a thing now I guess

2014-11-04 15:23:08	jhartigan	RoR means money tome, so unless its something silly like C&M i can hear it out

2014-11-06 09:37:18	kweaver	so i can officially say i no longer feel poor
2014-11-06 09:37:31	kweaver	just paid off everything, still have a good chunk to hang onto
2014-11-06 09:37:35	kweaver	today was a good day
2014-11-06 09:40:21	jhartigan	yeah my transfer went through too.  mines pretty decent after the phones, now ill start answering all the phone calls that want money from me
2014-11-06 09:40:32	jhartigan	after bills this month and med bills
2014-11-06 09:40:36	jhartigan	ill still be doing okay
2014-11-06 09:40:43	jhartigan	and we have so much still coming in
2014-11-06 09:40:45	jhartigan	its nice
2014-11-06 09:41:05	jhartigan	theres a surprising chunk incoming from katz i was surprised kweaver
2014-11-06 09:41:37	kweaver	oh werd?
2014-11-06 09:41:40	kweaver	thats true
2014-11-06 09:41:43	kweaver	they owe us a shit load
2014-11-06 09:41:59	kweaver	just keep track of the time youve done stuff in the last few weeks
2014-11-06 09:42:06	kweaver	and make sure to separate that as your own
2014-11-06 09:42:30	kweaver	we need to send them an october invoice
2014-11-06 09:43:50	jhartigan	yeah, did you see justines having problems getting them to pay
2014-11-06 09:43:53	jhartigan	she asked ken about it
2014-11-06 09:43:58	jhartigan	its like 4200 total form them
2014-11-06 09:46:04	kweaver	yeah its a shit load
2014-11-06 09:46:19	kweaver	at some point ill get in touch with justine and see what bc has been paid from them
2014-11-06 09:46:28	kweaver	it really shouldnt be this big a deal to get paid by them
2014-11-06 09:46:45	kweaver	if it continues to be a pain, we're just going to have to switch them to paying upfront for hours
2014-11-06 09:47:03	kweaver	and not do changes until theyve bought enough hours
2014-11-06 09:47:50	kweaver	we should make that switch regardless
2014-11-06 09:48:02	kweaver	for any larger client that will likely make changes
2014-11-06 09:48:35	kweaver	maybe switch pricing to $65/hr if you pay upfront, and $75 and hour if you are paying on demand
2014-11-06 09:51:40	jhartigan	yeah ut in the meeting, they stressed how they preferred being invoiced for hours vs paying up dront lol
2014-11-06 09:51:51	kweaver	ugh
2014-11-06 09:52:10	kweaver	of course
2014-11-06 09:52:18	kweaver	cause then theres no rush to ever pay
2014-11-06 09:53:00	kweaver	we'll just have to start enforcing a policy of "if your last invoice is over 30 days late, we can't continue to work until we've received payment"
2014-11-06 09:53:19	kweaver	because theyve gone as far as like 90 days im pretty sure
2014-11-06 09:54:56	kweaver	its frustrating too because stereotypes are funny to joke about, but kind of annoying when it actually becomes true
2014-11-06 09:55:28	jhartigan	i mean it is ridiculous
2014-11-06 09:55:31	jhartigan	they are 90 days
2014-11-06 09:55:40	jhartigan	and 30 on the sept payement too
2014-11-06 09:55:42	jhartigan	nearly 30
2014-11-06 09:55:51	jhartigan	cause sept was a 30 day window and 30 more is nov 10th
2014-11-06 09:59:42	jhartigan	you havent logged into Converge yet since VM switched over have you
2014-11-06 09:59:45	jhartigan	i got so excited
2014-11-06 09:59:51	jhartigan	but its just a front end swap
2014-11-06 10:10:35	kweaver	oh nah
2014-11-06 10:10:45	kweaver	so its the same, just prettier?
2014-11-06 10:12:19	jhartigan	its beautiful
2014-11-06 10:12:20	jhartigan	till you login

2014-11-10 15:40:33	jhartigan	and then just move on with amcharts
2014-11-10 15:42:04	kweaver	jhartigan: if they want to remove the amcharts logo at the top, and not be dicks to amcharts, its $140 for a full single site commercial license
2014-11-10 15:42:07	kweaver	http://www.amcharts.com/online-store/
2014-11-10 15:46:10	kweaver	but as the late great PJ once said "Our wallets run deaper than the atlantic ocean.  Your 'currencies' are of no concern to my people"
2014-11-10 15:46:15	kweaver	or something along those lines
2014-11-10 15:49:10	jhartigan	i think it was a direct quote
2014-11-10 15:49:12	jhartigan	you nailed it
2014-11-10 15:52:34	kweaver	i believe so
2014-11-10 15:55:03	kweaver	i kinda wanna leave ourselves at least 3 weeks for planners, and maybe one buffer week.
2014-11-10 15:55:22	kweaver	which gives us all of november (3 weeks) to finish longtail
2014-11-10 15:55:54	kweaver	which is pretty good
2014-11-10 15:56:27	jhartigan	yeah its why i wanna use am
2014-11-10 15:56:32	jhartigan	cauase i wanna finish early
2014-11-10 15:56:35	kweaver	same
2014-11-10 15:56:35	jhartigan	and get more monies
2014-11-10 15:56:37	kweaver	same
2014-11-10 15:56:47	kweaver	$$$$$$$$$$$$$ -> days
2014-11-10 15:56:54	jhartigan	uh yes
2014-11-10 15:56:58	kweaver	lol
2014-11-10 15:57:00	jhartigan	not sure what it means
2014-11-10 15:57:02	jhartigan	but yes
2014-11-10 15:57:04	kweaver	money for days
2014-11-10 15:57:09	jhartigan	haha okay
2014-11-10 15:57:16	jhartigan	just jumped to ruby in my head lol
2014-11-10 15:57:33	kweaver	set money to days
2014-11-10 15:58:53	kweaver	yeah i do wanna take them up on the mobile stuff.  like touch controls
2014-11-10 15:58:57	kweaver	and make more from that stuff
2014-11-10 15:59:40	kweaver	responsive alone (where we currently are) isnt enough to justify asking for more, but tying in special click events would be 
2014-11-10 16:00:57	kweaver	i kinda hope they have another project lined up for next year. them giving us money doesnt need to be limited to an end of the year habit
2014-11-10 16:09:14	jhartigan	yeah im hoping so as well
2014-11-10 16:09:25	jhartigan	when this closes out, we can always poke pjs brain
