2013-09-12 11:51:28	kweaver_laptop	what do you think we should say to bruiz about the timeframe
2013-09-12 11:52:57	kweaver_laptop	whenever we go a couple weeks without working on heroes, I feel like we are months away from even a basic form submission. but once we work on it for a couple weeks in a row and make progress, I feel like if we wanted to, we could bang it out by the end of the month
2013-09-12 11:53:56	kweaver_laptop	everything else seems to be slowing down, so I think ill start some heroes at night again

2013-09-12 12:28:29	jhartigan	haha okay. just got worried for you
2013-09-12 12:28:31	kweaver_laptop	about working on heroes
2013-09-12 12:28:36	kweaver_laptop	did it go through?
2013-09-12 12:28:41	jhartigan	no you did not
2013-09-12 12:28:51	kweaver_laptop	might not have been on the internet yet then
2013-09-12 12:29:57	kweaver_laptop	I just asked what we wanted to say in our response to brian about where we think the program is
2013-09-12 12:30:35	kweaver_laptop	and then I was saying how whenever we work on it for a couple weeks in a row, I feel like we could totes get something basic done by the end of the month
2013-09-12 12:31:02	kweaver_laptop	but whatever we go a couple weeks without, I feel like itll be months before anything
2013-09-12 12:31:05	kweaver_laptop	whenever***
2013-09-12 12:31:07	jhartigan	well as usual
2013-09-12 12:31:10	jhartigan	brian doesnt listen
2013-09-12 12:31:24	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants a recap 
2013-09-12 12:31:31	kweaver_laptop	to make sure we are working on it
2013-09-12 12:31:33	jhartigan	why sbe using it is even on his radar at this point i dont know.  honestly dude hes a royal paint to work with
2013-09-12 12:32:30	jhartigan	also i dont know what hes talking about wih char modifying her shit
2013-09-12 12:32:41	jhartigan	but as usual you never know what hes trying to actually say
2013-09-12 12:33:34	kweaver_laptop	eh, Im not pained by him just checking up to see how things are going. it's not like he's making any assertions about needing it asap, just looking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:33:48	kweaver_laptop	for shit**
2013-09-12 12:34:06	jhartigan	thats not what hes doing
2013-09-12 12:34:09	jhartigan	i guarantee you
2013-09-12 12:34:33	jhartigan	next time we talk to him hell be under the assumption that cumberland completion means heroes in a month
2013-09-12 12:34:38	jhartigan	its how he operatres
2013-09-12 12:34:55	jhartigan	i spent 8 months being his sole contact and he couldnt get anything straight no matter how often hes told
2013-09-12 12:37:39	kweaver_laptop	I think he just wants to know what to tell them, that's all.  I would want to do the same.  He said it before, he has no problem just telling them that it's billing only for now. He just wants to make sure that is still the case
2013-09-12 12:38:32	jhartigan	sbe has nothing to do with that
2013-09-12 12:38:52	kweaver_laptop	I didnt read his email as any sort of rush
2013-09-12 12:38:57	kweaver_laptop	just asking for a general idea
2013-09-12 12:39:01	kweaver_laptop	2014? 2015?

2013-09-12 13:23:47	kweaver_laptop	do you remember what that setting was?
2013-09-12 13:31:50	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I just checked, the A record is correct, and the SSL just ties into "irm.theflandershotel.com"
2013-09-12 13:37:31	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: I switched the A record to just "irm" since we have the mail A record as just "mail"
2013-09-12 13:37:36	kweaver_laptop	I would assume that is it
2013-09-12 13:38:20	kweaver_laptop	cpanel lists out the entire A record in their DNS settings, where as DO just wants the subdomain
2013-09-12 13:39:49	kweaver_laptop	I'm so pissed too because I specifically checked if the order was working last night, but my stupid network was still looking at the old site

2013-09-17 15:46:48	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: kweaver yo man. so sorry i didnt even hear you call.
2013-09-17 15:47:27	kweaver_laptop	lol I assumed at this point that you went to the hospital or something
2013-09-17 15:48:39	jhartigan	i was dreaming about some bullshit related to flanders, so i thought i was awake
2013-09-17 15:49:02	jhartigan	and then i woke up and realized i was out for almost 20 hours
2013-09-17 15:49:50	kweaver_laptop	I think its considered a coma at that point..
2013-09-17 15:50:05	kweaver_laptop	well at least youre alive
2013-09-17 15:50:07	kweaver_laptop	so thats good
2013-09-17 15:51:37	kweaver_laptop	so dougs site issue is a combination of his network already using the landistitle.com domain for shit, and our www cname record not being set up as its supposed to
2013-09-17 15:51:45	kweaver_laptop	if you go to www.omni-dev.com
2013-09-17 15:51:50	kweaver_laptop	youll notice the www stays there
2013-09-17 15:52:13	kweaver_laptop	if you go to any of our DO sites, www just redirects to the domain without the www.
2013-09-17 15:52:33	kweaver_laptop	so Im trying to set up our records to not drop the www, since that is what we will need to get in from his network
2013-09-17 15:53:09	jhartigan	that doesnt make ansy sense from a logical stand point
2013-09-17 15:53:14	jhartigan	www. is just a subdomain
2013-09-17 15:53:20	jhartigan	it actually doesnt affect any routing
2013-09-17 15:59:27	kweaver_laptop	brandon went in through his server and explained it briefly
2013-09-17 15:59:46	kweaver_laptop	he said the people that set up their network initially set landistitle.com to an internal ip
2013-09-17 16:00:14	kweaver_laptop	therefore, whenever they wanted to get to the site, the had to use www. which pointed out to the website ip
2013-09-17 16:03:17	kweaver_laptop	but since we have www.landistitle.com just forward over to landistitle.com, its pointing back to their internal ip which has nothing for the site
2013-09-17 16:04:47	jhartigan	oh dear god
2013-09-17 16:04:55	jhartigan	they hosted his site on his own serer?
2013-09-17 16:05:19	jhartigan	just swapping server name and alias should do the trick
2013-09-17 16:05:39	jhartigan	here i am digging in the fail2ban settings making sure doug didnt get banned
2013-09-17 16:07:44	kweaver_laptop	ima swap the alias and name now
2013-09-17 16:08:05	jhartigan	do that and a reload
2013-09-17 16:10:50	kweaver_laptop	done
2013-09-17 16:10:57	kweaver_laptop	now im getting a dns error for it on DO
2013-09-17 16:11:39	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan: 
2013-09-17 16:12:57	jhartigan	okay so that doesnt fix it..
2013-09-17 16:13:00	jhartigan	hmm
2013-09-17 16:15:50	kweaver_laptop	I tried like every combination of cname and a record for it
2013-09-17 16:16:08	kweaver_laptop	compared it to omni-dev's cpanel since those records work fine
2013-09-17 16:20:22	jhartigan	the only thing i can think of is with server name as www. no alias
2013-09-17 16:20:34	jhartigan	and a record for it as www. with no cname
2013-09-17 16:23:07	jhartigan	why didnt brandon remove the internal ip
2013-09-17 16:23:25	jhartigan	not that this is hi fault
2013-09-17 16:23:32	jhartigan	just a silly thing to leave up and running
2013-09-17 16:26:35	kweaver_laptop	not sure, maybe other shit relying on it?
2013-09-17 16:27:05	jhartigan	dunno. thats just shitty use of your domain.  i added www.landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:27:28	jhartigan	i dont think we move the mail over
2013-09-17 16:27:36	kweaver_laptop	?
2013-09-17 16:27:48	jhartigan	but probably need a vhost that serves only www.landis with no alias
2013-09-17 16:28:19	kweaver_laptop	thats a possibility
2013-09-17 16:30:24	kweaver_laptop	you added www.landistitle.com to what?
2013-09-17 16:30:49	kweaver_laptop	im going to try www.landistitile.com with no alias
2013-09-17 16:31:13	jhartigan	i already made the vhost
2013-09-17 16:31:17	jhartigan	and changed the original
2013-09-17 16:31:34	jhartigan	wait on some popigation for the www.landistitle.com domain on the digital ocean
2013-09-17 16:31:37	jhartigan	should onl be a sec
2013-09-17 16:31:38	kweaver_laptop	k
2013-09-17 16:33:40	jhartigan	whyd you add a wildcard subdomain?
2013-09-17 16:33:49	jhartigan	is that there for something important on landistitle.com
2013-09-17 16:34:39	kweaver_laptop	nah, just noticed it on the DO docs and thought its probably a good idea to use on other sites as well
2013-09-17 16:34:40	kweaver_laptop	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean
2013-09-17 16:34:42	jhartigan	kweaver_laptop: ?   if not i need to yank the * and www
2013-09-17 16:34:46	jhartigan	oh yeah
2013-09-17 16:34:48	jhartigan	i gotcha
2013-09-17 16:35:11	jhartigan	alright well that record was destroyed
2013-09-17 16:35:17	jhartigan	until that propigates upstream
2013-09-17 16:35:23	jhartigan	we cant really test the www. one
2013-09-17 16:35:42	kweaver_laptop	thats fine
2013-09-17 16:48:53	kweaver_laptop	any luck jhartigan ?
2013-09-17 16:49:00	kweaver_laptop	its still doing the same for me
2013-09-17 16:50:11	jhartigan	mines still dropping www. as well
2013-09-17 16:50:28	jhartigan	only been 15 but i would hope it would have went upstream
2013-09-17 17:00:07	jhartigan	man i followed everything i saw online to a t
2013-09-17 17:00:15	jhartigan	dunno why the new domains not resolving
2013-09-17 17:05:21	kweaver_laptop	bleh
2013-09-17 17:06:18	jhartigan	yeah i dunno
2013-09-17 17:06:37	jhartigan	it could be now a combination of the new configs trickling up to top level shit and local caching
2013-09-17 17:06:46	jhartigan	this is such a shit problem to have
2013-09-17 17:06:48	kweaver_laptop	yeah
2013-09-17 17:06:58	kweaver_laptop	it takes 20 minutes anytime you want to see if it worked

2013-09-20 11:44:34	kweaver	theres also some neat features like team share where I guess you can share juice ssh sessions on other devices
2013-09-20 11:45:00	kweaver	thatd be kinda neat to check out sharing between the phone and tablet
2013-09-20 11:48:27	jhartigan	yeah i saw that on there

2013-09-20 12:46:30	jharty	thats cool
2013-09-20 12:46:35	jharty	should we do write offs instead?
2013-09-20 12:46:37	jharty	or nah
2013-09-20 12:46:43	jharty	cause we could always agree that its 10 hours
2013-09-20 12:46:51	jharty	and get 600 + 300 in write offs for taxes
2013-09-20 12:47:02	jharty	kweaver: im gonna leave to drop this off for amanda soo

2013-09-20 12:51:20	jharty	i mean if you want. maybe call her back and tell her you have an idea that could work for both of us
2013-09-20 12:51:32	jharty	even if next year its free hosting and 500 in writeoffs
2013-09-20 12:51:36	jharty	its still writeoffs i guess

2013-09-20 12:52:19	jharty	Freelance professionals often have non-profits and charities as clients. Oftentimes the freelancer will agree to work for free because they believe in the work the non-profit is doing and want to cut them a break on their fees. So the question naturally arises, "Is freelance work done for charity deductible?" (This interesting question was sent to me by a reader via twitter.)
2013-09-20 12:52:22	jharty	The short answer is no
2013-09-20 12:52:23	jharty	maybe not

2013-10-01 10:50:20	kweaver	I was gonna call brian today and ask about kings custom clothiers

2013-10-01 10:52:27	kweaver	so I quoted $3000, she asked tim and brian if we could do $1500, I sent her a new quote with $1500, and a few less pages, she responded asking if "the site will still remain a $3000 value" and asked for a few of the pages to be put back in the scope
2013-10-01 10:52:29	kweaver	lololol
2013-10-01 10:52:49	kweaver	russo is on my list of reachouts, his last response was that they got really busy and he'd reach out soon

2013-10-01 12:15:24	jhartigan	it was a pretty shitty logo but i guess my recreation of shit was pretty stellar
2013-10-01 13:07:36	kweaver	jhartigan: I dont think casa is happening

2013-10-01 13:11:57	jhartigan	im working on some lunch at the moment.  whats good in the hood
2013-10-01 13:12:27	kweaver	just trying to figure out where we will be when Im done the photoshop work
2013-10-01 13:12:32	kweaver	hows everything on the drupal end?
2013-10-01 13:13:04	jhartigan	durpals installed and theres a sub theme
2013-10-01 13:13:06	jhartigan	its been that way
2013-10-01 13:13:11	kweaver	whats the parent theme?
2013-10-01 13:13:28	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon one
2013-10-01 13:13:42	jhartigan	which is sass/bouron of drupal default
2013-10-01 13:14:23	kweaver	did you add those to the default theme, or was there one you downloaded?
2013-10-01 13:14:32	jhartigan	hm?
2013-10-01 13:15:04	kweaver	did you just download sass/bourbon and use the default theme?
2013-10-01 13:15:11	kweaver	or was there a prepacked one you downloaded
2013-10-01 13:15:14	jhartigan	the sass/bourbon module comes with a theme which is default but preprocesses
2013-10-01 13:15:45	kweaver	ok, so its a seperate theme than the default one that comes with drupal
2013-10-01 13:15:47	kweaver	thats fine
2013-10-01 13:15:54	kweaver	you can deactivate the default drupal theme
2013-10-01 13:15:58	kweaver	we wont be using that at all
2013-10-01 13:16:45	kweaver	what's your next step then after lunch?
2013-10-01 13:16:57	kweaver	im going to assume that the remaining psd shit is going to at least take another day
2013-10-01 13:17:14	kweaver	and tomorrow is bc fun day
2013-10-01 13:17:36	jhartigan	oh shit thats right you have that css shit to do

2013-10-02 10:37:56	jhartigan	yo that cron job seems to be kicking ass and taking names on the server
2013-10-02 10:38:13	jhartigan	ii learned that cache is a bunch of shit. like moved files and stuff
2013-10-02 10:38:17	jhartigan	db entries im sure
2013-10-02 11:45:09	kweaver_laptop	nice jhartigan 
2013-10-02 11:45:26	kweaver_laptop	what ram usage have we been averaging?
2013-10-02 11:45:43	jhartigan	the only thing is.. im hearin you shouldnt need to use it. and essentially youre putting pressure onto the cpu
2013-10-02 11:45:57	jhartigan	like 1200 free has been the highest use ive seen since
2013-10-02 11:46:30	jhartigan	im wondering if theres a swappiness setting i should look at to aleviate it without clearing cache... although its not liek we touch our cpu power
2013-10-02 11:47:52	kweaver_laptop	yeah I dont imagine a custom cron job is that most ideal or average way that people handle it
2013-10-02 11:48:01	kweaver_laptop	but its a start until we find out what that is
2013-10-02 11:49:16	jhartigan	yeah its just odd cause ive never had the problem with anything before
2013-10-02 11:49:22	jhartigan	i think its actually a swappiness setting
2013-10-02 11:49:30	jhartigan	which dictates when to throw shit into the cahce
2013-10-02 11:49:32	jhartigan	cache*
2013-10-02 12:20:01	jhartigan	testing something thats a supposed proper fix for the server

2013-10-09 14:21:23	kweaver	AJPGTUSATVFS3L5TC7A4GGOWCHOIGYP4T
2013-10-09 14:21:25	kweaver	so you dont have to find it

2013-10-09 14:22:15	jhartigan	birdlady and steamicon?
2013-10-09 14:22:20	kweaver	yup
2013-10-09 14:22:32	kweaver	once we have raspberry guy pulling website backups, we should have him take backups of bitsync
2013-10-09 14:22:35	jhartigan	got them instantly on openeing my ac
2013-10-09 14:22:38	kweaver	in case anything happens
2013-10-09 14:22:51	jhartigan	what do you mean
2013-10-09 14:24:25	kweaver	basically just copy the entire bitsync folder, maybe once a week or so, save the last 5 or something
2013-10-09 14:24:40	jhartigan	yeah,. but we were just gonna host it on the pi
2013-10-09 14:24:47	jhartigan	so the pi always has a btsync serve
2013-10-09 14:24:53	jhartigan	and then we always get the files / changes
2013-10-09 14:25:00	jhartigan	so wouldnt that be better haha?
2013-10-09 14:25:02	jhartigan	also
2013-10-09 14:25:06	jhartigan	this shits fucking fast and awesome
2013-10-09 14:25:12	jhartigan	i just set up the secret on my desktop
2013-10-09 14:25:19	kweaver	yeah we would do that also, but copying it  would give us backups
2013-10-09 14:25:23	jhartigan	and its like OHMYGODTHERESFIELSTOGET
2013-10-09 14:25:39	kweaver	just fallbacks
2013-10-09 14:25:56	jhartigan	im not following you at all
2013-10-09 14:26:03	jhartigan	they are synced on different machines
2013-10-09 14:26:06	jhartigan	what are you backing up
2013-10-09 14:26:30	kweaver	our bitsync folder is going to become our everything in the world resources folder
2013-10-09 14:26:33	kweaver	with every psd
2013-10-09 14:26:43	kweaver	every website resource
2013-10-09 14:26:46	kweaver	every font
2013-10-09 14:26:48	kweaver	that we will ever use
2013-10-09 14:27:14	kweaver	Im suggesting that we create backups of that
2013-10-09 14:27:32	jhartigan	but youre suggessting backups of massive files that are not stored on 4 different machines
2013-10-09 14:27:32	kweaver	in case someone rm-r 's by accident and we lose everything we've ever done
2013-10-09 14:27:47	kweaver	4 different machines that are synced together
2013-10-09 14:27:47	jhartigan	deleted files go into .syncarchive
2013-10-09 14:27:53	jhartigan	so they dont go anywhere
2013-10-09 14:28:30	kweaver	so delete a file on a computer wont reflect the deletion on any other?
2013-10-09 14:28:34	kweaver	deleting**
2013-10-09 14:29:33	kweaver	oh damn okay
2013-10-09 14:29:36	jhartigan	unless you just got my deletions nope
2013-10-09 14:29:58	jhartigan	its in the archive now
2013-10-09 14:30:05	jhartigan	its a pretty cool service
2013-10-09 14:30:13	jhartigan	basically deleting it.. moves it out of sync for everyone
2013-10-09 14:30:15	jhartigan	but they keep it
2013-10-09 14:30:21	jhartigan	its actually badass as all hell
2013-10-09 14:31:04	kweaver	damnnn thats cool
2013-10-09 14:31:08	kweaver	yeah I didnt know it did that
2013-10-09 14:31:56	kweaver	if anything, there may still be reason enough for at least one backup, especially if we're tied to a 2-4TB hdd
2013-10-09 14:32:47	kweaver	there have been at least 2 times in my career where I've gone to save something, and accidently saved it over another file
2013-10-09 14:32:54	kweaver	i just did it last week with our omni site
2013-10-09 14:33:16	kweaver	saved fullsite.psd over graphic-design.psd by accident
2013-10-09 14:33:20	kweaver	and then its beat street
2013-10-09 14:33:58	jhartigan	probably best to use a workflow like project/workspace for all psds and then project/exports
2013-10-09 14:34:52	kweaver	what would exports be?
2013-10-09 14:35:32	jhartigan	actual images
2013-10-09 14:35:45	jhartigan	i mean saving overshit its always a danger
2013-10-09 14:35:57	jhartigan	a single weeklong backup probably doesnt prevent that
2013-10-09 14:36:31	kweaver	well we can decide what sort of backups we want to make depending on how much space we've got to work with
2013-10-09 14:36:59	kweaver	ill drop a little extra if it means no worries
2013-10-09 14:37:03	jhartigan	yeah thats not a problem.  its just one pi backing up massive psds
2013-10-09 14:37:12	jhartigan	isnt gonna be the same as getting compressed images and text
2013-10-09 14:37:20	kweaver	I think mazz said his office has a shit load of backups
2013-10-09 14:38:21	jhartigan	im sure they do
2013-10-09 14:39:15	kweaver	alright jhartigan, you might want to turn off bitsync notifications
2013-10-09 14:39:20	kweaver	im gonna start reorganizing everything
2013-10-09 14:39:43	jhartigan	they also dont run them over a pi.  im sure it can handle it, but depending on the backup schedule that folder is gonna shit the bed for the pi
2013-10-09 14:39:49	jhartigan	haha are they obnoxious?
2013-10-09 14:40:03	jhartigan	they arent bad on my mac?
2013-10-09 14:40:08	jhartigan	that wasnt a question hah
2013-10-09 14:40:09	kweaver	not sure, I just know ive got 23k files in box now
2013-10-09 14:40:23	kweaver	i dont think I have them turned on here
2013-10-09 14:40:25	kweaver	ill find out
2013-10-09 14:40:34	jhartigan	structure it how you see fit and well see what happens over here
2013-10-09 14:43:06	kweaver	hmmmm
2013-10-09 14:43:57	kweaver	let me sit/shit on it
2013-10-09 14:44:13	jhartigan	thats gross!
2013-10-09 15:33:26	jhartigan	the menus working. i think ittll look good as a sticky one and is a good break from the parallax should someone scroll past its current location
2013-10-09 15:33:35	jhartigan	so pooryly worded
2013-10-09 15:33:37	jhartigan	back to the top
2013-10-09 15:57:39	kweaver	sweet jhartigan
2013-10-09 15:57:57	kweaver	Im organizing this stuff locally, then I'll move it all into bitsync last
2013-10-09 15:58:10	jhartigan	yeah thats cool
2013-10-09 15:58:15	jhartigan	i figured thats best
2013-10-09 15:58:27	jhartigan	btsync is seriously impressive kweaver
2013-10-09 15:58:37	jhartigan	like insanely awesome
2013-10-09 15:58:38	kweaver	jhartigan:  I wonder if things  would poop itself if we nested our local google Drive root directories inside our bitsync folders?
2013-10-09 15:58:59	jhartigan	i wouldnt bother
2013-10-09 15:59:02	jhartigan	thats redundant
2013-10-09 15:59:05	jhartigan	if youre gonna keep it in drive
2013-10-09 15:59:09	jhartigan	its always online/offline
2013-10-09 15:59:44	kweaver	yeah, It doesnt really have to.  it would just be really nice to just consolidate our documents too
2013-10-09 15:59:53	kweaver	thats kinda the last piece of the puzz
2013-10-09 16:00:18	kweaver	might not be worth the headache if things break though
2013-10-09 16:00:52	jhartigan	yeha i mean if you wanna consolidate docs that way. we can export from drive
2013-10-09 16:00:55	jhartigan	into hard files
2013-10-09 16:00:57	jhartigan	and go thatroute
2013-10-09 16:01:02	jhartigan	but drive is good at that
2013-10-09 16:01:11	jhartigan	documents and resources are a lil different i guess

2013-10-14 14:11:15	jhartigan	fuckin jira gets partially there this time.. gonna do ghost first and fuck with jira later on
2013-10-14 15:42:20	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  how goes ghost?
2013-10-14 15:47:01	jhartigan	who knows
2013-10-14 15:47:05	jhartigan	being a bit of a pain
2013-10-14 15:48:58	jhartigan	trying a couple differnt things   found one guy who ran it with nginx so im adapting it
2013-10-14 15:49:10	jhartigan	i think the installs fine actually its jut not showing up on that port or something
2013-10-14 16:48:59	kweaver_laptop	would it be worth using nginx as well?
2013-10-14 16:49:08	kweaver_laptop	jhartigan:  I know thats what tom uses
2013-10-14 16:49:13	kweaver_laptop	instead of apache
2013-10-14 16:57:31	jhartigan	nginx is awesome
2013-10-14 16:57:38	jhartigan	its a bit more complicated for php
2013-10-14 16:57:43	jhartigan	but i can figure it out if we wanna do that
2013-10-14 16:58:05	jhartigan	should i use a second server.. set one up tonight? i 1gb jira / omni-blog and demo server?
2013-10-14 16:58:08	jhartigan	dev*
2013-10-14 16:58:15	jhartigan	gonna go feed my dog and take her out
2013-10-14 16:58:22	jhartigan	just lemme know what you think about it
2013-10-14 17:17:10	kweaver_laptop	yeah I think we should always have a second server running for testies
2013-10-14 17:17:31	kweaver_laptop	theres still a lot for us to play with on the server end 
2013-10-14 17:17:35	kweaver_laptop	stuff like nginx
2013-10-14 17:18:24	kweaver_laptop	1 gb jira wouldnt work though, right?
